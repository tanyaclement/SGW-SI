Okay, this is— Autobiology is a book  that came out, two years ago this month, actually, 72, yeah. And I started writing it in Westmount <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q139497\">w</a></sup> as they say and finished it in Kitsilano <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4179275\">w</a></sup>. I started writing it in an expensive flat in Westmount, and finished it in a commune on the edge of the water in Vancouver and it's a story about, as it suggests, it's a story, it's a book, it's poetry, it's prose, it's something about things that have changed me in terms of my head but first in terms of chemicals and physiologically, changed my body literally and so on. So I'll just, I'll read portions of it. I toyed with the idea of reading the whole book, it's the sort of thing we do in Vancouver, like we sit down and read the whole book, and this was published the same day as Stan Persky's <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2330087\">w</a></sup> The Day, a book called The Day, and it's the same length, about a hundred pages, and he read The Day and we took a break, and I read Autobiology and then we took a break of a couple of hours and he read The Day again. But that's sort of— that happens a little— it's a little easier to take when everybody is kind of a volunteer anyway, when everybody in the audience has known all the time that this was being written and that it was going to be read, the whole book. So I'll just read parts of it so you get a taste of it. Each section is about one and a quarter foolscap pages when it's handwritten, long, approximately so it turns out to be about two of these pages. \"Chapter One\"— there's forty-eight chapters. \"Chapter One: The Raspberries\".",

I'll just, I'll pick, this is Curious, which is a— that other book's coming out, it's called In the Flesh and it's maybe the last book of occasional, magazine book verse poetry I ever do. It deals with the experience of being in your 30s and finding out that the world isn't round after all and how sad you can be and how strong emotions can be. It has an introduction called \"I Never Felt Such Love\". But it's mainly lyric poetry, and I just, I've read so much of that that it's got to be too easy to read and write and everything. So I'll read a few of these. The poets who are mentioned in Curious, it happens that there are a lot of my friends who aren't in the book. Because, again, I wrote it that way, if you know, if that person did not come up, excuse me, from the other side of the page or however that feeling is to be described, if the voice wasn't there or something, for instance I really wanted to do a Roy Kiyooka <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3445789\">w</a></sup> poem, and you know, I just couldn't and it didn't come and I had wanted to but if I had tried that it just would have been screwed up. Some of these are American, some are Canadians, a couple are English and maybe one or two other things. And the first one is, naturally, Charles Olson <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q922978\">w</a></sup>. Olson, as you probably know, was about 6 ft 10 and weighed about 300 pounds. And I first met him— I was standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs and he was coming down them. So I said 'hello' to the knees of his sear-sucker suit.",

David McFadden <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5237344\">w</a></sup> is, this is the David McFadden piece and maybe I'll read it and a couple more. It's not my favourite but it's one that I like reading. David McFadden— well, it tells you what he's like, but David McFadden is a— he scared the hell out of Allen Ginsberg <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711\">w</a></sup> because he writes really funny poems, like he literally has things, like he walks out into the backyard and sees the Archangel Gabriel <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81989\">w</a></sup> or a space man and just talks to it and talks about it in the story of the poem a paragraph after he's talked about going out and buying some cigarettes or something like that and Ginsberg thought, wow, what a weird spaced out guy, so Victor Coleman <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23882910\">w</a></sup> took him down to Hamilton <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133116\">w</a></sup> to see David, David— he's got, as he said in the note of one of his books, \"I was born in 1940 and I comb my hair straight back\", and in his house, he's got an electric pendulum clock and you know that sort of thing. And Ginsberg took one look and said [inaudible ‘scared’ sound], and ran away. Just couldn't believe it, you know, it's unbelievable. So, David McFadden.",
