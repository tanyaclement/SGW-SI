And so I was suddenly taken by that, because, you know, if you write dates very often, you probably use the typical numerical method of you know, putting, the day, and the month, and the year, in terms of numbers. And you usually think of September as the ninth month, which in fact it is, in our calendar, but the word is obviously, suggests, as October suggests the eighth month, September is the seventh. And so I was happy. It seemed like something new was happening. It was nice, because you know, in September, in northern, any part of Ottawa <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1930\">w</a></sup>, Ottawa-area, or Ontario <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904\">w</a></sup>, or Quebec <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q176\">w</a></sup>, you know what's coming, eh? You know, it's still here. So you got to be happy while you can. And it was also, I should add, that even in old times, you know, the calendar year was divided into twelve months, and so the seventh month would, in a sense, be the beginning of a new cycle. It would be six months, and that would end the first half, and there would be six more months, and September would be the first of it again. And that also excited me. It felt like Spring. [Laughter].

I think I was pessimistic, I'm always terribly pessimistic about something like that, I don't find it easy to be optimistic in such situations, and optimism, the optimism that I now have again for this person is only as qualified, I dare say. The poem is entitled \"A Lifetime\", and the more I thought about that word--I didn't get the title easily, I had to work it out--and the more I thought about that word, the more it began to mean to me. I think if you really think about that word, lifetime, as one word, it's very peculiar. And then I thought, I was thinking about time-life [audience laughter]. And that really, that was really funny. It's strange, isn't it, that those, that, that corporation should own those two words, as they do. It's very difficult to use them. We can't just call it--like, can you imagine putting out a magazine called Life? You know. Or Poetry magazine. These are very good names for a magazine. Or Time, you know. That's pretty big stuff! [Audience laughter]. What could they--and look what they've done with it, you know. So reduction is still possible [Laughter]. \"A Lifetime\"...And one other thing [laughter] before I begin this one, it's not altogether this way, you've probably, you know, you've probably found that my lines, my poetry, has a tendency, especially in the earlier poems, to be, like they say, poetic, you know, to try to be a little, to try to sound pretty. It was something that meant a great deal to me earlier, and means a little less to me now than it did then, though beauty still means as much to me as ever. I have tried, I have looked for in my poetry--and one thing, it was very pleasant hearing Ron's <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2165471\">w</a></sup> poems tonight, is a quality of voice, a quality of language, that doesn't necessarily try to be pretty at all--that tries to use the language that we are actually living with. I don't mean to try to talk about the old problems of prose and poetry, or anything of the kind. But just that, language needn't necessarily be quote, poetic, unquote. We had kind of a talk about that last night, at the reading in Ottawa, it was pretty funny. And this poem, just at least its beginning, it has that colloquialism that I enjoy.",

This poem has taken me at least two years to write, a little longer than two years to write, I think, and has been written over and over and over and over again, and like I said about time/life, this one has also suffered a phenomenal reduction, starting out as about six pages and ending up as three, which is usually a good sign. Originally there was a line in the poem, something about the presages of civilization, you know, are on my back or in my ear, or something like that, and it was a horrible line. Like a lot of the other lines it had to be excised, and rewritten, and so forth. But the thought of it, the thought of that word, the meaning of that word, contained, lived with me, and lived with my sense of the poem. And so I've entitled it simply, \"Presages\". And also, to make it a little more comprehensible, I've put a sort of bracket, subtitle, \"From a Sixth-Floor Apartment\". Actually, the poem was begun in Manhattan <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11299\">w</a></sup>, not in Manhattan, I'm sorry, in Queens <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18424\">w</a></sup>, New York, when I was staying at my in-laws' house a little over two years ago, just briefly, and was written from their sixth-floor apartment. It actually, the strange thing about this poem is it was mostly written since then, really re-written, although the first part is pretty much as it was originally.",
