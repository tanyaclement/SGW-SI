He brought the school of Buddhism, which is called the school of Mind Only, and the school of Emptiness. That's one aspect of this next poem. Another aspect is a little petroglyph, American Indian petroglyph figure, called the hump-backed flute player, a little stick figure playing the flute, with a pack on his back, walking. He was found pecked on the rocks from Sonora <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46422\">w</a></sup>, Mexico <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96\">w</a></sup> up into the Great Basin, and about which almost nothing is known. The Ghost Dance, which was a Messianic Indian religion, started by a Paiute named Wovoka https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q558420], which asserted that perhaps by magic the white man could be swept away from North America and the game would return.  And finally, the oldest living beings are the bristle-coned pine, who live in the White Mountains <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1556007\">w</a></sup>, at an elevation of nine thousand feet in eastern California, the oldest of which is something like four thousand five hundred years old. So this poem is called \"The Humpbacked Flute Player\".",
