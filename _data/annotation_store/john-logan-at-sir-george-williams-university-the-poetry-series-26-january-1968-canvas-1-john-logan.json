It was written when I was teaching [Wetky's (?)] courses a couple of years ago in Seattle <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5083\">w</a></sup> for a couple of quarters. The physical beauty of the North West got me very involved and I wrote a number of poems about it, of which this was the first.

I found that I couldn't write about the Indian community, I wrote rather about the sea and myself.",

Probably if you can't see me it should be marvelous. It’s called \"A Trip to Four or Five Towns\" and I dedicated it to James Wright <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6145850\">w</a></sup>, simply because he liked it. There's a reference toward the end of the poem to a visit to William Carlos Williams <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178106\">w</a></sup>, and there's also a reference to a story about e.e. cummings <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298703\">w</a></sup>, told by Charles Norman in his biography of cummings about a long night spent at [Archebold (?)] and [unintelligible] with them living in France <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q142\">w</a></sup>, cummings was working for the New York Herald Tribune <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q532494\">w</a></sup>, I think, perhaps another New York <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60\">w</a></sup> paper, there aren't that many. But on the way back from the party, cummings had the urge to take a leak, and so he did so, but it was Champs-Élysées <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q550\">w</a></sup> or some extraordinary [audience laughter] place like that and the cops saw him. They brought him to jail, and they said, 'You piss on Paris <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90\">w</a></sup>' [audience laughter]. He said, 'No ,it's not the point, I just had to take a leak', but they kept him there the whole night and when he finally got back to his office in the morning they had signs posted up around, which said--and I don't read French, I'm sorry because I know that many of you know French--but it was something like this, “[unintelligible] pisseur Americain”, which I guess translated \"Let the American pisser go\".

Williams by the way, did not read his Sixteen new poems, he had them, but he couldn't read them because he'd had a stroke and had never heard them. I visited him with Galway Kinnell <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2425705\">w</a></sup>, and he asked us to read the poems, and we did. But I thought that, you know, one of the great things about poetry is that you can make it the way that it should be, so I had him read the poems. This is \"Big Sur: Partington Cove\". I went with a couple of students to, well we were in the Big Sur <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q859413\">w</a></sup>, and this is a very hidden place, Partington Cove <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21551591\">w</a></sup>. A marvelous place, accessible only by a tunnel shored up by ancient timbers, I feel I am sort of repeating the poem by telling you this, but there is such a cove, and you can only reach it through a tunnel, it's very beautiful. Smugglers used the cove and a cave nearby to hide booze during the prohibition, it was used for other purposes before and since, and there are--well why not? [Audience laughter]. But you can't get there at all now, I tried to revisit when I was back there last spring, but it's all roped off. And even the one time I did get to go there, there was a sign that was supposed to scare you away. The, one of the motivating things behind the poem was my understanding for the first time of what happens in some paintings that a friend of mine Jim Johnson <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100239918\">w</a></sup> does, where he uses combinations of landscape and the human body. He will have for example, mountains coming off an arm, and the figure of a clown. I had an experience which this poem talks about that made me see for the first time the kind of rapport between body and landscape. It was important to me, and part of what happens to the poem.",
