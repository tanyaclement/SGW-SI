Trying to decide what I'm going to read this evening, presents the same sort of problems that it always does, when one's being asked to divide oneself up into certain sections, decide which poems you like best, and you know, you love them all, and don't want to make any choices. And to find some headings, some pigeonholes. Well, I'm not very good at this, but I'll start off with a few poems about the United States, about Canada <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16?wprov=srpw1_0\">w</a></sup>, starting off with places, and then move on to some slightly more personal ones, before the interval. Alright, the first poem I want to read is called \"Modus Vivendi\", which, it sounds a bit affected, having a foreign language titles, but I felt this said a little bit more than simply 'way of life' because ‘modus vivendi’ implies something very transitory, and that was one of the aspects of my first impressions at least of American life, that struck me very forcibly, this really came out of my very first day in the States, traveling from New York <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60\">w</a></sup> to Chicago <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1297?wprov=srpw1_0\">w</a></sup> by train.",

I'm not trying to be arch or archaic or anything like that, simply to expand my vocabulary and, hope to, therefore, I can say new things.
