These are the trials and tribulations. And right now we're waiting for a panel of three federal judges to come and see it and decide if it has redeeming special significance. [Audience laughter]. And if they don't think it is, we'll take it to the Supreme Court <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11201\">w</a></sup> and see what they think.

They're--they only thing on the set with them is a table and two chairs covered with furs and Harlow is wearing a blue gown and she has a purse with her and a mirror and the Kid is dressed in a costume appropriate to his costume--I mean appropriate to his career. And when the curtain opens, there's an orange light shining on him which goes up after the first, about the first thirty seconds. And being that this is a poem in the form of a play, I can only read it, I can't read it properly, I can't be two people, I can't be Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow I can only be the author so I'll have to read it that way where it's actually meant to be a poem and acted by me on a stage, on a shelf with lights.

The book is called Ghost Tantras, ghost like the German word \"gist\", g-i-s-t, which means spirit, and I just said \"ghost\". Why can't ghost be a spirit, why can't we use that in English? And tantra, t-a-n-t-r-a, which is a Hindu form of poetry, it's poetry written in an invented language for magical purposes to bring about changes in the universe. I felt these poems, I felt these poems coming on, and I felt like I had a ball of silence within myself, within my body and I heard these sounds within that ball of silence, and I wrote them down phonetically, so kind of like Marvel comics <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q173496\">w</a></sup>, you know where it says \"keee\" or \"rash\", k-e-e-e, or r-a-s-h. And I see later that things like this have been done in gnostic Bizantine chants too, which also, is like Marvel comics. \"Ka-pow\". And some of them were written in San Francisco, some of them were written in airplanes, on the way to Mexico <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96\">w</a></sup>. I was going to Mexico to bring back cultures of [unintelligible] Mexicana, the sacred [salsavie (?)] mushroom which were grown by scientists in Brooklyn <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18419\">w</a></sup>. And, then upon my return I finished from there. I finished these \"Mad Sonnets\", there are 99 of them and I don't think you've probably heard anything like them before, and I guess all you can do is just relax. I like to start with one that starts with English because it's not so strange, they're about a third English or half English maybe.",
