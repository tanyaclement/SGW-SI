If this were Monday, or up to a week from tonight, I would be able to join the Angry Art Week. I don't know if anybody else has received these letters, but in New York City initially they're trying this and anybody who gets a letter from them is asked to dedicate any reading or event to what they're trying to do. You can still send them money, too, I'll give you the address if you want it later. What they're going to do is play harps in railroad stations and have...lets see, Bach <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1339\">w</a></sup> cantatas in railroad stations, play-ins in various museums and the lobbies of concert halls, recital halls, business buildings--I like that one--dramatic presentations in laundromats and supermarkets, [audience laughter], a paint-in, and fences and billboards throughout Manhattan <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11299\">w</a></sup> with their work showing and so on. This is a series. \"What we're trying to do is through art to reach the American people as human beings.\" So...[audience laughter]. If this were Monday I'd dedicate the reading [audience laughter and applause]...This is all very orderly, although it doesn't look it, and it starts with other people's poems of various kinds. A little section of C. Bukowski <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76409\">w</a></sup>, somebody said that's Charles, an American poet. It's a great long thing that was in a mimeograph magazine, and the description is of a woman with a bicycle and a baby carriage, high-heeled shoes, white socks, and all her belongings, on a hot day in the middle of a road in a city.

It's the poem of Gyula Illyes <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q381107\">w</a></sup>, called \"Of Tyranny, In One Breath\". Ilona Duczynska <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q967353\">w</a></sup> did a literal translation for me and then read it to me for sound and we worked through it that way.  Apparently the poem started, or happened, in 1956 in Budapest <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1781\">w</a></sup>. Illyes had written it some years before but hadn't been angry enough at the time to risk what it was to bring it out. But he grew angry enough and somebody said the one thing that nobody censors is the magazine which tells you what lectures are going on where and what movies are running where and is just a news sheet, and the middle spread was for advertising, so they printed this in the middle sheet and it was, they tried to stop it as soon as the authorities found it but by then they were storming the radio station or however it started. I can't do it in one breath because it goes on for several pages. In the first part of it, \"it,\" meaning \"tyranny\" is small \"i\" and towards the end it's a capital \"I.\"",
