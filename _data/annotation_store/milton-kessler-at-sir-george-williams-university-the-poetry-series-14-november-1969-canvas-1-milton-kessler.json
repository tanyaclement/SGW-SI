And it always sort of surprises me you know, that it's alright. \"Surprise\". Let me tell you a little about this situation--but if I tell you too much about it then I'll read it, you know, I can talk more and it's a little poem. But it was after a big war-type reading at the Loeb Center in New York, and after that, everyone went out, you know, and roaming around all night, and then about 4 am or something like that I got on the subway and went out to my parents' place in Rockaway <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62569\">w</a></sup>, New York, on the ocean. And when I walked into the place, to their new house, I went to the--I walked in and saw that they were sleeping. And I had such a strong feeling, because when I was a kid, you know, and I used to come in late, either the door was locked, you know, the door was locked or there was this always this--come in after eleven, and you know, you won't get, you know, after eleven the door is locked, climb in through the fire escape or something. But here, you know, it was alright, and there it was and I stood and looked at them sleeping. They're both about 70. And by the way, extraordinarily happy. The poem is called \"Surprise\".",

This is a long poem that I wrote at a time, it's only some times that it's of any interest what these things develop out of, you know, but this one I think is kind of interesting. I had this very bad, I pulled a muscle in my calf, climbing a mountain, actually, in New Hampshire <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q759\">w</a></sup>, where the mountains aren't too high, you know. And I was in a barn, I was at the MacDowell Colony <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3273867\">w</a></sup>, and I was in a barn, and I couldn't get out, I couldn't move any place, I had one big jar, you know, next to the floor, sort of thing, and I just stayed there, and they would come around and bring me some food, finally about a week later I couldn't do anything and somebody--Hortense Calisher <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436082\">w</a></sup>--I don't know if you know who she is, just finally came along and took my car, drove me to the airport, and that was that, kept the car. But while I was lying there, I said there's no big deal about it, but I have had asthma since I was seven, and the one thing about that, you know a little bit like Proust <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7199\">w</a></sup>, if you just lie around, you just lie there and then you sort of, alright, so here you are. So you just do something I guess, so this poem, \"Summer's End\", there are a lot of things you do with these things lying around. I'll tell you--\"Summer's End\" alright, \"Summer's End\".",

It has only the slightest bit to do, by the way, with a woman in my family who I've recently come to know about, her name is Minnie, she is an aunt, she's my father's sister, she's been in the Rockland State Hospital <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22061059\">w</a></sup> for over forty years. Only recently did I find out about her existence. And I remember when I talked to Allen  <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711\">w</a></sup>, oh a few months ago, and he said something, he was just talking about the kind of people who are locked up, and he said it's like mini, you know, like mini, and I said that's it! My aunt Minnie, I have this aunt, and he said, well, go, go and see her. You know, what's happening there, how many times she could have been alright, well of course, this is just a little bit to her maybe, but I think I may have been thinking about it a little.
