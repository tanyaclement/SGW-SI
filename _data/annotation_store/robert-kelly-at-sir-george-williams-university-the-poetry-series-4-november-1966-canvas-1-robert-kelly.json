Fellini <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7371\">w</a></sup> makes fun of it in that 8 ½ <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12018\">w</a></sup>, the girl in the old Hindu...But I think rhyme is madness and rhyme is pain, and maybe poets will no longer have to be madmen now that we have come to abandon rhyme. Don't you think that free-verse poets are less mad then rhyming poets? [Audience laughter]. They need order somewhere else, they can't keep it there. Alright. I mean A.A. Milne <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207036\">w</a></sup> was probably the craziest man in the world. [Audience laughter]. This is a hard poem in a number of ways, the music of it interests me very much, it's a variety, it all fits on one page somehow but it's a long poem. It's based on the word ‘Gala’, the old Greek word for 'milk' from which we get obviously galactose and galactose but also galaxy from milky way, gala way.",

But I don't want to read them all. God, I don't want to read all 150 of them. I tried that once, not publicly, but I couldn't do it, even privately, even with coffee and the ability to s-m-o-k-e, can't do that here…[Audience laughter]. There is much said in this world about city, I mean I see all around me here the evidence of a monumental concern with city, and we're taught to think about Socrates <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q913\">w</a></sup> and polis and all of that--polis, city, the community of men, and we haven't said all that has to be said about it. In the last 100--the last 50 sections of \"Weeks\" I get very involved with that. I get very involved with the fact that we do build cities as we build rooms with no place to sit down, with no air, and so on and so forth, and the simplest way we can find that objectionable is simple: Animals, but in a different sense we have allowed that sense of community to destroy something that's closer to the bone, that possibility of a man's doing, and this is what experimental art is always about isn't it? A man doing his own work, that's the hardest experiment of all to do and to maintain, to continue doing your work and not somebody else's. So this is 107, it's about 'polis', the Greek word for 'city' if I am not pronouncing it clearly.",
