Alcuin <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q154332\">w</a></sup>, the Charles the King, Alcuin was an 8th century scholar who was brought from his, from the York <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42462\">w</a></sup> diocese, to the court of Charlemagne <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3044\">w</a></sup>, and there became the principal architect of Charlemagne's attempt to bring Latin and Latin culture to the Francs. You might say, I suppose, that he was the first of, first great humanist, but we'll see what his Latin is worth in this poem. This is a letter, written by Alcuin, actually it was written by me, presumably written by Alcuin, to Charles the King.",
