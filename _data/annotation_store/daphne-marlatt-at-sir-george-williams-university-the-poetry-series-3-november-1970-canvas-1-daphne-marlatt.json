          "value": "The first poem in the book is sort of a, an entranceway to the book as a whole, it in some ways it sets up my method, I originally had, I'd been reading a lot about Japanese Noh plays, and I'd especially been interested in the Spirit Plays and my original figure in here was a Shite, who is the doer, the central figure in the Noh, who performs the dance and who the particular Noh is about. He usually first appears in the spirit plays as an old man, an old fisherman, or salt-gatherer, some kind of beat down, destitute person, an anonymous person, and the Waki comes along and somehow starts up a conversation and begins to wonder about this man, and usually asks him to tell him the story of the place where he is, assuming that this is some sort of historical shrine, which it often is, and the Waki has come specifically to see this place and as the old man begins to tell the story, he, well, there's actually a scene change, an act change, he reappears in all his glory as the original person whose life was lived out, usually tragically and very dramatically, often in a battle, who died in this place and whose spirit consequently haunts the area. Then I started reading about the Kwakiutl who are a tribe of the Indians somewhat to the north of Vancouver, about the furthest south they reach is the Campbell River <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270481\">w</a></sup> on Vancouver Island <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170479\">w</a></sup> which is, I don't know how many miles north of Vancouver, 100? 80, about 80. But I always figured that there must have been some sort of interchange between the Kwakiutl and the Salish, the particular tribe around the Fraser Delta <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q269710\">w</a></sup>  in Vancouver. The thing that interested me the most about the Kwakiutl were one particular secret society called the \"Hamatsa\" and in the Hamatsa it writes, one goes into a sort of frenzy and is possessed by the original spirit, who then passed on the rituals, and the frenzy denotes the acquirement of a certain kind of power. I guess the Salish have something a little corresponding to that in that they have, I don't know what you call them, they're certain kinds of dances which are meant to perform the meeting between the individual who dances, the initiate, and the spirit of the particular place whom he encounters and who gives them, in result of this dance, particular powers. \"Wet fur wavers\", this is a Spanish Banks <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7573148\">w</a></sup> poem, about a walk, a Sunday walk along the Spanish Banks.",

She could be seen, often around Berrard and Granville streets, and instead of going into the White Lunch, she used to go into the Bay, Hudson's Bay <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q641129\">w</a></sup>, and sit on the benches outside the elevator, and wait to warm up, I guess.

But in this particular occasion, these three Indian brothers somehow won her sympathy or something, but she told them, Baxbakwalanuksiwe’ was out at the moment, she told him that he would be expected back and that they were supposed to be his victims, and that the only way to overcome this was to build, to dig a deep pit in the floor, cover it over with boughs and then and have a trap that he could spring, that could release the boughs, and then when he did his dance, prior to killing and eating his victims, they would just pull the string or whatever it was and he would then fall into the pit. And then they could set fire to him. Qominaga is the woman, and I don't know if I should explain the B.C. <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1974\">w</a></sup> liquor laws or not. [Audience laughter]. Well, for those of you who don't know B.C., up until not so very long ago, what, five? No, must be longer than that, maybe ten years, the beer parlors used to be segregated, and men, alone, sat on one side, and women, alone, and women would be the escorts sat on the other side and you had to enter the beer parlor from different doors, one of which was marked \"Men\", and the other was \"Ladies and Escorts\". The men's side also used to have, in some of the beer parlors, used to have a wooden floor covered with sawdust, which was simply easier to keep clean because of course when expected, there were constant brawls on the men's side and a lot of broken glass and spilled beer, I suppose that was the rationale.
