          "value": "I want to read some, most of the poems from this section called \"Book of Ayres\", and I want to explain just a little bit about it if I can, I guess the most important thing to say is that they declared themselves as a book of poems, in the middle of a final exam, I was taking an exam and one of the things that we had to deal with was a poem by Emily Dickinson <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4441\">w</a></sup>, which I will read to you, it's a marvelous poem, I'd never seen it before. And it's so clearly tied all of the poems I'd been working on for the past year or so together, into a bundle, into a package. Let me read to you the, this little statement which I'd written for the publication of the book, and I, simply to insist that they are before anything else, religious poems, and I, as prepossessing as I am about them now, because I think that I may have occasion later on in the reading to call that, or you may have occasion to call that to mind. That they take, as their focus, the making, the finding of the flesh in the word, that is that the word is flesh and it has to be found as such. But let me just read this statement and then I'll read you the Emily Dickinson poem, we'll go right into the “Book of Ayres”. I hope that they're, also, that they're fun, and then you say 'religion', people say, 'uh-oh', this is going to be very grim and very heavy, and in the old sense of heavy. But I hope we can have fun with them, but simply, let me do this. All the poems in the “Book of Ayres” section Meat Air, were written with the intention, though not entirely conscious ‘til rather late in the series, of making the word flesh. That is, when the poet speaks, his words are physically only air, yet they can afford us the most sensorially tangible of experiences. Further, the poem, though merely air, is what sustains us, what the soul feeds on. The poet speaks to keep the soul of man alive, that's Yeats <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213\">w</a></sup> in  “John Kinsella's Lament for Mrs. Mary Moore”, it's interesting that as I was grabbing for something to, for support, picked that line, because the line continues, or rather the whole passage goes \"And oh, but she had stories, though not for the priest's ear, to keep the soul of man alive, to banish age and care, and being old, she put a skin on everything she said.\" Or as Williams <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q178106\">w</a></sup> puts it, \"It is difficult, to get the news from poems, yet we die, every day, for lack of what is found there.\" Yet if the word seeks to take on the actuality of flesh, of substance, substance itself, as the poet apprehends it, in the merest of tales of his life, from day to day, seeks to take on the resonating actuality of speech, to realize itself in the actuality of the word. Love itself is both a word and a continuing act or process, both an idea and a tension in the chest, viscera and genitals, a pressure toward articulation so complex that it often stifles speech. About halfway through “The Book of Ayres”, I realized that many of the poems I'd written over the past twelve years or so, had been attempting with various degrees of success to effect these transubstantiations and so, this collection. \"The Dickinson Poem\", which if you want to take a look at it is in Thomas Johnson's editions, it's number “1651”.",
