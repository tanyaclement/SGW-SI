One time I was leaving shopping in the Army and Navy and a guy came down the hall and said, Look you know, they're trying to get a hold of you, you've gotta go up there. And I said, come on, now, and sort of walked me back to the hall. And one Christmas run there were fifty one men--lots of people don't want to go out at Christmas, but a lot of the seamen, just work in the summer, so if they can get a job for two weeks they take it. They had fifty one cards on the board and not one of them--and there was a call for a cook, which was a girl's job and a call for an able seaman, and not one of the fifty-one men would go out on the boat--they got a guy who hadn't registered yet went out.
