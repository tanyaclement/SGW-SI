Quote: “As far back as I can remember there was a kind of dumbness within me, a need that sought expression. How it eventually materialized in the act of writing a poem belongs to a biography which I have only been able to recount in a few successful poems. As for the finished product, the poem, my need requires it to be of, as Whitman <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81438\">w</a></sup> said, the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, and further, if they are not yours as much as mine, they are nothing, or next to nothing. On a subjective level, I write to give being to that vibration which is my life, and to survive in a hard time”. Charles Simic <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q722555\">w</a></sup>.",
