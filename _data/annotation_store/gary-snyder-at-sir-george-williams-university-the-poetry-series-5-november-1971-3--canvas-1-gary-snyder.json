          "value": "Well, there has been a great deal of opposition to nuclear energy, and nuclear power-generating stations, in the United States so effective in some areas that a lot of generating plants have been blocked or slowed down in their construction. And I think that the United States government is about to launch on an enormous effort to calm the public and to lull it into accepting massive developments of nuclear energy generating centres, fast-breeder and later, perhaps, fusion. Now I myself would have no objection to such a thing if I could be convinced that it was safe, both in the long term and the short term, and although it might be conceivably safe in the short term, I can see no way in which it would be safe in the long run, because nuclear wastes accumulated over, say, several centuries, as they might be, or more, in increasing quantities around the globe, are going to out eventually, and even though you can say, well, we're putting it off for five hundred thousand years, five hundred thousand years is not a very long time.  And if we are feeding a wasteful, industrial, technological, consumer society for a few more centuries, buying it a few more centuries of life, at the expense of all future biological health on the planet, it's obviously not worth it. The Amchitka test, which is possibly interested in such things as what uses very large explosions would have in releasing oil from oil-bearing shale or something like that, I think the U.S. administration is going ahead with this test in the face of all this criticism, deliberately, as a deliberate and very intelligent gamble. The chances are that nothing will happen. When nothing happens, then they will be able to say, \"All you people were hysterical. You see?  Nothing happened\".  And that will buy them a lot of time and a lot of credibility to proceed strongly and forcibly with more nuclear testing and more nuclear power generation development. And the conservationists, perhaps, have in a way, played into their hands, by making such a big issue out of it, so that they will be left holding an empty bag if nothing happens. If something does happen, then the administration can say, \"You're right, we were wrong\", and Nixon <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588\">w</a></sup> perhaps forfeits the next election.

The state of California at the moment is engaged in a large, incredibly wasteful, incredibly stupid, illegal, even by their own terms, water plan project, which if they're lucky, will salinate the Sacramento Valley <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1686914\">w</a></sup> and make agriculture permanently impossible. I was up in the Minarets <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2412852\">w</a></sup> in the Sierra last summer, thinking about the California Water Plan <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28228216\">w</a></sup>, and I perceived something of what the true California Water Plan was. So I wrote this down. It refers to an obscure little Buddhist god called Fudo, or Achala <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q337624\">w</a></sup>, who is my particular guardian, my personal guardian and my personal teacher, and, so I use, I refer to him, in several poems. The other two poems in which I refer to him actually are a piece called \"Smokey the Bear Sutra\", and another piece called \"Spell Against Demons\". This is the final, actually, this is the third and final poem in the trilogy of Fudo poems. Also. But you'll find all about Fudo in this poem, it'll drive you crazy.    ",

Now, the rest of these poems that I'm going to read this evening are cutting back and forth between ancient India <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q668\">w</a></sup> and ancient North America. I--living as I do and where I have lived all my life, we face the Pacific <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q98\">w</a></sup>. And, the American Indian came from Asia <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48\">w</a></sup>, or vice versa, the Asians came from North America. I mean I know a Shoshone who says that. He says, \"We've always been here, those Asians came from here\". [Laughter].  \"What do you mean we came from someplace else, that's some white anthropologist theory\". [Laughter]. \"Kumarajiva's Mother.\" Kumarajiva <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q335293\">w</a></sup> was a great Buddhist monk-scholar-translator, who was kidnapped by the Chinese from Central Asia, by force, and carried off to China <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q148\">w</a></sup> where he was made to translate Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Chinese, and he stayed there the rest of his life, with a crew of about eighty Chinese assistants, day and night, translating sutras. He did a lot of translation. He also got in trouble, because he liked girls, and on one occasion, because he actually had mistresses apparently, he ate a bowl of needles, like you sew with needles, in front of an assembly of all the monks and assistants in Peking <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q956\">w</a></sup>, or no it wasn't Peking in those days, it was Chang'an <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6501000\">w</a></sup>, all of the monks and assistants in the capital, Chang'an, and then he said, \"When you boys can eat needles, you can have girlfriends too\". [Audience laughter]. But this poem is about his mother. [Audience laughter]. And I really, I mean I could explain to you why I wrote this poem but it isn't really worth explaining, I'll just read it. It has to do partly with the fact that my mother has freckles. And I was trying to figure out at this time, when I wrote this, I was trying to figure out whatever happened to women in Buddhism? Like something happened to 'em. They got lost. For a long time, anyway.",
