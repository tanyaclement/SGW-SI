          "value": "Thank you. Well let me begin by refuting one of those statements that Stanley just made, Stanton, I'm sorry, just made. I was not a singing vacuum cleaner salesman, that was a canard that was incorporated into my vita by my publisher, who misread a biographical note I wrote. I once worked for a vacuum cleaner company that made its salesmen sing pep songs before they went out to tackle the ladies in the neighbourhood, so we'd get up in the morning and sing all these ridiculous songs and then go out and try to sell vacuum cleaners but the two were not really related, it was just hyping oneself up for the gritty day of trying to sell these poor ladies on a vacuum cleaner. Now I've seen you've kindly reproduced, and incidentally you've been most kind here in Montreal, I've been received royally, more so than any place I've been lately to read poetry and I greatly appreciated, I feel it's kind of a homecoming since my mother is a Canadian, from Ontario <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904\">w</a></sup>, not Quebec <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q176\">w</a></sup>, but I've been in Montreal <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34\">w</a></sup> many times before and I'm very fond of this city and if I finally lose patience with the U. S. and A. <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30\">w</a></sup> as Walt Kelly <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q933892\">w</a></sup> says in Pogo <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2100584\">w</a></sup> I'll migrate up here, I feel it an eminently sensible thing to do. So it's nice to have a pleasant reception here. And since you've kindly reproduced one of the poems from a group called \"Mouth Organ Tunes: the American Lost-and-Found\" on your mimeographed sheet, I thought I'd start off by reading that poem. I'm going to say a few words at the risk of being dull about what each one of these poems I'm going to read is for, what I meant it to mean. This particular one is talking about the well, kind of what James Atlas was talking about in his comment on my second book, this is in my third book, the terminal flatness and greyness of American life, United States life, and the attempts to alleviate this barrenness by all sorts of temporizing accommodations, going to Howard Johnson's <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5919997\">w</a></sup> on a Sunday, or having a kinky party in New York <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60\">w</a></sup> to show off one's new paintings or celebrating the death of a genuine antique American and New Englander and looking at the house that he lived in and so on. Anyway the tune is called, the poem is called \"Mouth Organ Tunes\", and I use the mouth organ as an instrument here to suggest the, well the mouth organ is something that can be played in a band, but is better not, it's a very solitary instrument and to me it always conveys the loneliness of an individual against insurmountable odds. The poem is called \"Mouth Organ Tunes: The American Lost-and-Found\" and the first section is called, as promised, \"In a Ho-Jo's by the River\".",
