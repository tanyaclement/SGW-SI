Christopher was not just in the poetry workshop, but was doing a lot of translations from German and Dutch, writing his own poetry, was a kind of formidable character with these obscure languages, at least obscure to me at the time. He has since come on, after doing his Ph.D. at Carleton <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1041737\">w</a></sup> where he is an Assistant Professor of English. His third book of poems, Stills, is being published in the next few weeks by Chatto and Windus <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3666843\">w</a></sup>, and should be looked for at your bookstores. He's asked for it to come but it hasn't arrived yet. So without any further delay, Christopher Levenson. ",
