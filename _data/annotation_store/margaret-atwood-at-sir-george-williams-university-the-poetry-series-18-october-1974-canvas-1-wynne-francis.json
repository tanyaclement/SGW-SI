It's not often that an artist excels in two medium such as poetry and fiction as our guest tonight does. Miss Atwood's reputation as a superior poet was established in the 60's with her first collections, The Circle Game <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7723073\">w</a></sup> and The Animals in that Country <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7713834\">w</a></sup>. And while continuing to write fine poetry, six major collections to date, she's given  us two novels in the last five years, The Edible Woman <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7731579\">w</a></sup> and Surfacing. With the second novel, published late in 1972, within a few months of a controversial work of criticism, Margaret Atwood became one of Canada's <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16\">w</a></sup> best known literary artists. The hypothesis of Survival, a study of patterns in Canadian lit is that Canadians see themselves as victims. I was remind of Survival recently when I came across a nineteenth-century curiosity written by one John McTaggart <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463553\">w</a></sup>. It was a book published in London <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84\">w</a></sup> in 19-- excuse me--1829. McTaggart wrote \"There's a melancholy which is peculiar to Canadians which must be combatted. People who labor under it must be encouraged, the soothing language, good treatment and now and then as circumstances require, a little assistance gratis as a stimulant.\" McTaggart's third point about the helpful effects of a little assistance as a recent theory has been taken up by the Canada Council <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2993809\">w</a></sup>, to whom we are in part indebted for her appearance tonight. Margaret Atwood's work constitutes an exploration of what it means to be a Canadian, to be a woman and to be a human being. She writes about our totems, our tapestry of manners, our progressive insanities. She taught at Sir George in 67-68, and it's a great pleasure to have her return to us tonight. After her reading, she'll be open to questions from the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Margaret Atwood.",
