A year and a half after I got back from the Arctic, I got a bill for a hundred and ten dollars from the construction company that I thought I'd, whose plane I thought I'd hitchhiked on. Which I haven't paid. But anyway, all of these poems, except perhaps I think one or two, were written up there, written in the Arctic, except that after I got back from the Arctic I kept revising them.

So that when you go, as all, everybody must go at some time or other in their lives, possibly once a day or not, one takes an Eskimo kid along to throw stones and keep the dogs off. When I came back from the Arctic I saw an hour-long film about the George River <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q966023\">w</a></sup> Eskimos, and one scene in it showed about fifty Eskimos trying to get into a tent, and the Eskimos beating them into the tent, and the next thing you showed the same dogs trying to get out of the tent and the Eskimos beating them out of the tent. And the announcer said not one single word. And then I remembered that whenever the Eskimos leave a campsite, they use it for a privy, and then send the dogs in to clean up. So, actually, this is a poem about that.  \"When I Sat Down to Play the Piano\". [Audience laughter].",

When Robert Kennedy  <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25310\">w</a></sup> was shot...I always think about anything that I'm interested and emotionally moved by, always, at least I have in the past, till I got to Simon Fraser, think about writing a poem about it. So the same thing was happening after Kennedy was shot and died, and I was thinking about writing a poem about it, and then the Star Weekly <sup><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17112122\">w</a></sup> phoned up and asked me to write a poem about it.
