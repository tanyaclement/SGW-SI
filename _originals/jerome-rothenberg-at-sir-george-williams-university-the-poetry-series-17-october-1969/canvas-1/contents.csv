Audience	00:02:53	Applause.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:02:58	The birthdate'll come clearer in the second part of the reading. I'll read in two parts. And in the first set, what I'll be reading are translations and re-workings of American Indian poetry, which have been important to me over the last five or six years. And I'll start with some which are based on earlier translations, re-workings of material previously translated, and then as I get into it, some translations that result from direct contact and direct experience of American Indian poetry. This is an Aztec poem. The first four or five, six poems will be Aztec or Mexican in origin, and the theme will be flowers.  "Offering Flowers".
Jerome Rothenberg	00:04:24	Reads "Offering Flowers" [from Technicians of the Sacred].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:07:37	This is Aztec, too, in origin, translated through the Spanish.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:07:52	Reads “A Song of Chalco” [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:09:53	And it doesn't die out, even with the destruction that follows, and flowers are picked up again, this in a series of translations, again through the Spanish, of a series of Peyote songs, from the Huichol Indians of central Mexico <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96">w</a></sup>. The name Wirikuta <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8026952">w</a></sup> is the name given to the place of the gods, and the spiritual place of the Peyote. The Peyote is described as the rose, it's described as the corn, the maize, it's described under a number of images, and through the figure, the mythological figure of one called the Blue Stag. This is the first Huichol, Peyote song.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:10:46	Reads “First Peyote Song” [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:11:46.19	"Song of an Initiate".
Jerome Rothenberg	00:11:51	Reads "Song of an Initiate" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:12:25	And this is a poem called "How the Violin Was Born: A Peyote Account”.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:12:35	Reads "How the Violin was Born: A Peyote Account” [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:13:24	These are a few short Indian pieces. Not poems but part of what's connected with the whole activity of poetry, among the tribal peoples. Which is more than an activity of words; which goes beyond language. And these are the events that accompany the words. And the first is an Iroquois dream event. 
Jerome Rothenberg	00:13:58	Reads ["Dream Event 1", published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:14:08	These are a series of vision events. The first two are Eskimo.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:14:14	Reads "Vision Event I" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:14:25	Reads "Vision Event 2" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:14:39	And this is a Sioux Indian vision event.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:14:43	Reads "Vision Event 3" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:15:01	This is a Kwakiutl Indian gift event. All the words are from Kwakiut'l Indians. It's either spoken in English or translated into English. The Kwakiut'l, like other Northwest Coast people, celebrate the potlatch, you know, which is not always terrible or distasteful in its consequences. This is benevolent gift-giving. 
Jerome Rothenberg	00:15:26	Reads "Gift Event [2]" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:16:32	These are a series of seven Navajo animal songs. 
Jerome Rothenberg	00:16:42	Reads "Navajo Animal Songs" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:17:49	The next few are from a series of translations I've been doing, are called, well, it's the Seneca Indian word for one of their major curing ceremonies, a term for a major curing ceremony, "Shaking the Pumpkin", because the pumpkin rattle, the big pumpkin rattle is the major instrument used in this. Or it's got a more ornate name, it's called "The Society of the Mystic Animals". The man, Richard Johnny John, Indian, who is working with me on this, explained it's a serious ceremony, he said, but if everything's alright, the one who says the prayer tells them, I leave it up to you, folks, and if you want to have a good time, have a good time. Well everything's alright in the translations, you know, so one eases up there. The translations are done trying to follow everything in the Seneca, including the meaning of the sounds, the hey-ya and the way-oh-hey, that are very common in Indian poetry. Basically the way I do it is to present them visually on the page, and I can't do this in reading them, so I'm just going to select out of these poems that read easily. The purpose is curing, and well-being. 
Jerome Rothenberg	00:19:34	Reads ["Caw Caw the Crows Caw Caw" published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:19:49	Reads "Two more about a crow, in the manner of Zukofsky" [later published in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:20:05	Three poems about the owl, on the page, the vocables, the sounds, make the figure of an owl, even as in the singing of the song, the sound of the owl comes through. But here are just the words.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:20:19	Reads "The Owl: One".
Jerome Rothenberg	00:20:25	Reads "The Owl: Two".
Jerome Rothenberg	00:20:32	Reads "The Owl: Three".
Jerome Rothenberg	00:20:40	"A Song of My Song, In Three Parts”.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:20:45	Reads "A Song of My Song, In Three Parts" [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:20:59	Reads “Three Ways to Screw Up on Your Way to the Doings” [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:21:16	Buckets are important, to bring back soup and...The last one from this series.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:21:31	Reads “Where the Song Went Where She Went & What Happened When they Met” [published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:22:15	The next are a little harder to do, but I hope I make it. The Senecas don't use many words. It's a kind of minimal poetry and the power is in the compression. The Navajos use more words, the poetry gets dense, and in addition they use many many non-verbal sounds. And in addition, they distort many of the words in the singing. So that if you translate just for the meaning, you're only getting a small part of what the Navajo is doing. And then in addition, everything is sung in the Navajo. So I began to translate a series called, because that's what they are, "The Seventeen Horse Songs of Frank Mitchell". Seventeen horse-blessing, horse-curing songs that were the property of a Navajo medicine man named Frank Mitchell. And the problem that came up for me, I couldn't translate just for meaning, I wanted to, you know, consider all of the factors that went into the poem. So I began to insert sounds corresponding to the sound of the English words as the Navajo had the meaning of the sounds, and to distort the words. And then it seemed to me that it was necessary to carry this further, to begin to sing the songs as well. Which came to me with great difficulty. But I've gotten through a number of them now, and what I'll do is sing one, the "Tenth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell," and then do a tape for three voices of another one of the horse songs. You'll notice the words are rather similar from one to another, the melody changes. In this, and the Navajos of course would know this, the hero, Enemy-Slayer, has gone to the house of his father, the sun up there, to bring back horses for the people. And in this Tenth Horse Song, it's mostly the father, the sun, speaking, telling him to bring the horses back to the house of his mother, you know, who everybody understands to be Changing Woman. Bring it back to the earth. And sometimes the voice of Enemy-Slayer comes into it.  But the basic refrain is to "go to the woman, go to her." 
Jerome Rothenberg	00:25:24	Performs "Tenth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell" [from The 17 Horse-Songs of Frank Mitchell]. 
Audience	00:31:25	Applause.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:31:38	The next one, and I guess the last piece in the first set, is the "Twelfth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell". The melody changes. Some of the distortions change. The burden changes, and now Enemy-Slayer contemplates the horses coming back to earth with him, in the same sequence. This is done on tape, with three voices. I think that's about all there is to say about it. Three voices.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:32:23	Plays recording of "Twelfth Horse Song of Frank Mitchell", sung by three voices [from The 17 Horse-Songs of Frank Mitchell and published later in Shaking the Pumpkin].
Audience	00:39:42	Applause.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:39:48	In fact, let me end this set with a live poem, I don't want to end with a machine. This is another Aztec poem called "The Flight of Quetzalcoatl". The plumed serpent, bird-snake man. In which he discovers that he's become old, and leaves and goes on a long journey, and is reborn as the morning star.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:40:39	Reads "The Flight of Quetzalcoatl" [later published in Shaking the Pumpkin].

Unknown	00:47:27	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:47:28	The second set will be a straight reading, whatever that means, from a long series of poems called "Poland/1931". A series of ancestral poems. So Poland <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36">w</a></sup> is where the ancestors come from, for some number, hundreds of years. And that is Jewish Poland. And 1931, rather than 1921, is the year of my birth. And it's in a sense, though I don't keep to it too strictly, everything before that. To try to build up a world that I really don't know.
Jerome Rothenberg	00:48:29	Reads "Poland/1931: The Wedding" [from Poland/1931].
Jerome Rothenberg	00:50:46	Reads "The King of the Jews" [from Poland/1931].
