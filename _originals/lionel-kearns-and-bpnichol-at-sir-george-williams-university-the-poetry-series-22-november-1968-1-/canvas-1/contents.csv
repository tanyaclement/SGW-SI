George Bowering	00:00:00	The second reading in our third series, I don't feel very happy tonight that the crowd is nice and big, and also that because I don't quite know what's going to happen, although I've heard rumours. We have Lionel Kearns <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6555690">w</a></sup> and bpNichol <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4953105">w</a></sup>, as you know, and they have elected instead of doing a reading by each poet, with an intermission in the middle or anything like that, a manner of joint reading. And I think, in a sense, that makes a lot of sense, because Lionel Kearns is by one of his professions, a linguist, and also one of his main, one of his main themes is the social care of human beings. bpNichol is a radical therapist, and is known especially for his border-blur poems, and it makes a lot of sense, I think, for that reason that they do read together. They read together last night at Carleton <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1041737">w</a></sup>, apparently worked out very well. Lionel is as you probably know is one of the centres of the so-called Vancouver <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639">w</a></sup>Renaissance that took over Canadian poetry in the 1960's, threatened to do that too [laughter]. bp was one of those blessed children from the east, although he had lived in Vancouver before, who kept his ears open. Well, he says he was born there. bp managed to grace the city of Vancouver for a few years and I guess that's where he got the ears open in the first place, but since that time he's been opening all our ears. So seeing as how this reading threatens to last four hours, according to rumours, I think I'll stop now and give the floor to either, and, or bpNichol and Lionel Kearns.
Lionel Kearns	00:02:26	Well, I'll begin by reading a poem called "Telephone". It's what I call a media parable, I have a whole set of poems that are media parables and things, which are coming out in a collection very soon. This one is called "Telephone".
Lionel Kearns	00:02:49	Reads "Telephone" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface; audience laughter throughout].
bpNichol	00:07:04	What you're going to get out of me this evening is a strange pastiche, since I managed to do that clever thing of losing everything I wrote over the last year. So this is selected weirdness.
bpNichol	00:07:23	Reads [“Monotones”, part I from Gifts: The Martyrology Book(s) 7 &”]. 
bpNichol	00:08:45	Reads "Uneven Song". 
bpNichol	00:09:28	Reads unnamed poem. 
Lionel Kearns	00:10:26	Reads "Word" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Lionel Kearns	00:11:27	I'll read a series of quiet poems. Because we've got some really loud ones to read too. "Poem found among the ruins".
Lionel Kearns	00:11:43	Reads "Poem found among the ruins" [published as “Medium” in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Lionel Kearns	00:12:19	This one's called "The Business".
Lionel Kearns	00:12:24	Reads "The Business" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Lionel Kearns	00:12:43	This one is called "Genres”.
Lionel Kearns	00:12:45	Reads "Genres” [published as “Content” in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Lionel Kearns	00:13:51	Reads "The Answer" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Lionel Kearns	00:15:05	And this one, derives from my seeing a piece of sculpture, an exhibition of Haida art I think, or some West Coast Indian art. A little figure of a woman carved, a carved figure of a woman, but she is in a very strange position, she's doing a kind of funny thing. It seemed worth writing a poem about. It's called "Labio Digital". [Audience laughter].
Lionel Kearns	00:15:55	Reads "Labio Digital" [published as “Sculpture” in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
bpNichol	00:16:41	Reads "The True Eventual Story of Billy the Kid" [published  later in The True Eventual Story of Billy the Kid and collected in Craft Dinner: Stories & Texts 1966-1976; audience laughter throughout]]. 
Lionel Kearns	00:20:46	This one is called--I'll try reading with both the mic and without the mic and if you can't hear me, then shout and tell me that you can't hear me. I'll try this one without the mic. It's called "Gestured” My titles are always very abstract. That's not very abstract [audience laughter]. Most of my titles are very abstract. This is written for a friend, I had to [inaudible] with a sketch.
Lionel Kearns	00:21:32	Reads “Gestured” [published as "Expression" in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Audience	00:22:36	Applause [cut off].
Lionel Kearns	00:22:39	Actually, actually, I don't think it's a good idea to clap in between the poems, because bp and I have got so many good poems that you're going to wear your hands out. [Audience laughter]. This one is called "Transport", it's also a media parable.
Lionel Kearns	00:22:56	Reads "Transport" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Unknown	00:26:32	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
bpNichol	00:26:33	There's things that I try to be absolutely very, very personal [inaudible] thing I ever wrote. I wrote it at Port Dover <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7230589">w</a></sup>, in, on Lake Erie <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5492">w</a></sup>. It's one of those days when I was flaked out on the beach, covered up because I get vicious sunburns and just peel the whole summer, and in the background was playing "(There’ll Be Bluebirds) Over the white cliffs of Dover" and “What’s New Pussycat” sort of juxtaposed, there was sprawled over the beach was this weird phrase "Podunk" and these two cats were playing football overtop of my head. So anyways I felt very sort of, weird, and wrote the following poem.
bpNichol	00:27:25	Performs unnamed poem.
bpNichol	00:29:06	Hugo Ball <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q70989">w</a></sup> was kind of the daddy of us all, and he was kind of a very fine dadaist who lived in Switzerland <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39">w</a></sup> during the first World War <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q361">w</a></sup> and sort of did the first sound poems. It was very strange, if you read Hugo Ball's diaries, it's rather fascinating because it was more or less, when he gave these sort of his final public reading he got really carried away in the midst of a sound poem an kind of got thrown back into sort of a--how to put this--an earlier space in his mind, anyways he went back and started remembering all sorts of things right back through his life doing this sound poem. As you read the diaries, there's a real feeling he became totally terrified of what was happening to him. Because at that point he then just split and left the whole thing behind. So this is kind of for Hugo Ball. It's called "Dada Lama". This poem's gone through so many changes I can't even keep track of it anymore.
bpNichol	00:30:28	Reads [sections of Dada Lama: a sound sequence in six parts, collected later in Selected Writing: As Elected]. 
Lionel Kearns	00:33:38	I'm going to read some poems now from my collection, Pointing, which I see is for sale out on the other room. These poems are, for the most part, quiet poems, poems of my own measured voice. They're poems that originated a few years ago and they came out of the general West Coast poetry scene that was going on very intensely--hello?
George Bowering	00:34:09	It’s hard to hear... 
Lionel Kearns	00:34:10	Is it hard to hear back there with this? 
Unknown	00:34:12	Ambient Sound [voices and laughter].
Lionel Kearns	00:34:20	I'll try--If I talk louder into the mic can you hear that? Keep letting me know, if you can't hear, shout. I'd like to read this one into the mic because they aren't poems that can be shouted. This one is called "Situation" and it derives from an experience I had in Mexico <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96">w</a></sup> many years ago. 
Lionel Kearns	00:35:06	Reads poem "Situation” [from Pointing].
Lionel Kearns	00:36:24	How's that for sound, can you hear that? "Insights".
Lionel Kearns	00:36:36	Reads "Insights" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface]/
Lionel Kearns	00:36:55	I'm very sentimental [audience laughter.] This is an early poem I wrote, it's called "Homage to Machado". It's really a translation of a poem by Antonio Machado <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q243771">w</a></sup>, the Spanish poet. I've not only translated it, I've switched the central image, but used his statement. His image was that of a boat going across a lake and he looked out and saw the ripple of the water behind it and  then commented on that. But I changed the metaphor.
Lionel Kearns	00:37:45	Reads "Hommage to Machado" [from Pointing].
Lionel Kearns	00:38:17	Reads "Remains" [from Pointing].
Lionel Kearns	00:39:08	Reads "Total Presence" [from Pointing].
Lionel Kearns	00:40:05	A very small poem called "Witness".
Lionel Kearns	00:40:07	Reads "Witness" [from Pointing].
Lionel Kearns	00:40:38	And this one, called "Profile". I'll read it without the mic.
Lionel Kearns	00:40:45	Reads "Profile" [from Pointing].
Unknown Audience Member 1	00:41:32	Have you ever thought of pausing it and--
Unknown	00:41:34	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
Lionel Kearns	00:41:37	We thought of reading all of our quiet poems at the beginning, and then getting louder and louder and louder, but we thought this would get you too excited and you'd go out onto the street and...[audience laughter.] So we decided to mix them all up and you'll get everything quiet and loud and funny and very serious and that's part of it,you know,getting them all at once all in juxtaposed relationships.
bpNichol	00:42:12	This way you can sort of do what you want with which ones you wanna do. It's very hard to listen to a poetry reading all the way through. I can never hack poetry readings myself [audience laughter]. What Lionel and I are trying to do is maybe do you a favour so you can listen for a longer time maybe [audience laughter].
Lionel Kearns	00:42:32	Who locked the door? [Audience laughter].
bpNichol	00:42:37	Among my poems from the last year which I lost, was a very long thing called The Martyrology which included all these things about a whole series of saints I'd evolved. Which had included St. Reet and St. Ranglehold and St. And and it's kind of too complicated to go into what they all sort of were doing, but St. Ranglehold came from the word 'stranglehold' and the rest you can kind of figure out maybe.
bpNichol	00:43:05	Reads unnamed poem from The Martyrology series.
Lionel Kearns	00:43:56	Was that loud enough by the way?
bpNichol	00:43:58	Could you hear that? It's hard to tell from behind here. This is a poem called "Ruth" and it was for a good friend of mine, David W. Harris, who now calls himself David W. And it begins with a quote from Ruth.
bpNichol	00:44:20	Reads "Ruth" [from Ruth].
bpNichol	00:46:20	Reads unnamed poem. 
bpNichol	00:46:57	And this uh, this is a poem that begins with a line from a poem by bill bissett <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4911496">w</a></sup>. Actually--
Unknown	00:47:01	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
bpNichol	00:47:18	Reads unnamed poem. 
Lionel Kearns	00:49:43	We'll try it up there. It's called "Color Problem".
Lionel Kearns	00:49:49	Reads "Color Problem" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Lionel Kearns	00:50:06	This, I'm going to read a concrete poem now. bp inspires me so much with his concrete poetry that I have begun to write concrete poetry too. Some concrete poetry is purely visual and you can't read it, it's to go on walls and things like that. Other concrete poetry is so sonic that it's nothing really to look at, but occasionally you can get the two combined so that you have something on the page which also is something else when read, but the two correspond. This one that I've got is to some extent like that, on the page it's called "Studies in Interior Decoration Border Design" because of the way it looks on the page, which of course being an audience at a poetry reading, you aren't concerned with. But I'll read it  and it does work, I think, sonically too. It's called "The Woman Who Reminded Him of the Woman Who".
Lionel Kearns	00:51:20	Reads "The Woman Who Reminded Him of the Woman Who" [published as “The Woman Who” in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface].
Unknown	00:53:14	[Cut or edit made in tape. Recording cuts to bpNichol_lionel_kearns_i086-11-0262.mp3 00:37:59].
Lionel Kearns	00:53:25	This one is called "It".
Lionel Kearns	00:53:28	Reads "It" [from Pointing].
Lionel Kearns	00:54:02	A lot of the poems in this book--
Unknown	00:54:05	[Cut or edit made in tape. Recording cuts back to approximately 00:53:13].
Lionel Kearns	00:54:15	This is called the "Kinetic Poem", my poem is called the "Kinetic Poem".
Lionel Kearns	00:54:26	Reads "Kinetic Poem" [from By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface] with bpNichol.
Unknown	00:55:57	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
bpNichol	00:56:00	Kon Ichikawa is the name of a Japanese film maker that made a film about the Olympics <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5389">w</a></sup>. Okay? How should we start this out--'all together now?' [audience laughter].
Lionel Kearns	00:56:15	Think--think, pretend you're at the Olympics. [Audience laughter].
bpNichol	00:56:23	“Karnijakawa--Karnijakawa”, follow me. 
bpNichol	00:56:30	Chants "Kon Ichikawa” pronounced as “Karnijakawa" repeatedly with Lionel Kearns and the audience.
bpNichol	00:57:11	Thank you.
Audience	00:57:13	Applause [cut off].
Unknown Audience Member 2	00:57:16	Karni-jakawa!
Lionel Kearns	00:57:22	Carne means meat in Spanish. I was at Louis Dudek's <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3261787">w</a></sup>, at one of his courses today and we were talking and the students were talking and so on and I was reading a few poems, and they said, "Why are you so pessimistic about things?" and I'm not so pessimistic, and I'll read a poem now that's got an up-beat ending [audience laughter].
Unknown Audience Member 3	00:57:59	What led them to deduce your pessimism?
Lionel Kearns	00:58:00	I read a poem without an upbeat ending [audience laughter]. This is another media parable. And it's called "The Parable of the Seventh Seal" and naturally, it derives from a movie. Um, the movie called The Seven Samurai <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189540">w</a></sup>. [Audience laughter.] Or you've probably seen that, there's a,Hollywood <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34006">w</a></sup> derived a few movies from that, one of them called The Magnificent Seven <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19069">w</a></sup> or something like that. The original one was a Western made in Japan <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17">w</a></sup>, and Hollywood stole the idea and made a Western in the West. Now I've taken the same situation, the same story and given it a Northern locale. And that's why it's called "The Seventh Seal" [Audience laughter]. It was published in this New Romans thing, and that makes it an anti-American poem, but it really, when I wrote it, I didn't have this book in mind. But they paid me $30 so [audience laughter] I put it in here.
Lionel Kearns	00:59:38	Reads "The Parable of the Seventh Seal" [published as “The Seventh Seal” in By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures and other Assaults of the Interface; reading cut off].
