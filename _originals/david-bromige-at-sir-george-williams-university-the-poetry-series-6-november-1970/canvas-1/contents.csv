David Bromige	00:03:07	And I got this take, this poem was printed in a magazine that George Bowering <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280">w</a></sup> edits, Imago, Number 13, I think.
David Bromige	00:03:21	Reads "First Love" [published later in Threads].
David Bromige	00:07:08	See, what I was working there was both the delightful self-indulgence of being able to tell that story over to myself after so many years, but, what I had coming out in the poem before, the one about the light elves who danced the dark elves out into the light in order to petrify them, as an Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic conception, which has a lot to do with our idea of what a poem is or what a work of art is. And so then I had this matter of the one you love coming to you and enabling you to be both light and dark elf to yourself, so that the two of you...whose particular form had never been, without her, it was that cultural attachment to particular forms, also, that I was hoping to tell the story, part of the story of, again, there. Okay, here's “Psychoanalysis”.

David Bromige	00:14:59	Reads "Example” [published later in Threads].
David Bromige	00:15:11	Yeah, this would seem to be very useful here. "Choosing the Event". This came out of the troubles, the people's park troubles in Berkeley <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q168756">w</a></sup>. Whenever it was, I can't remember now, the year before last, I guess.

David Bromige	00:17:18	Reads "Logical Conclusions" [published later in Threads].
David Bromige	00:17:47	I still don't know who it was. I figure if I keep reading it, sooner or later someone's going to break. But it's not very likely here. "An Invention".

David Bromige	00:22:19	And so I want to read a poem from my first book. It was written in Vancouver <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639">w</a></sup>, of Vancouver. Well, I'm not a...particular landscapes don't often come into my poetry but here all kinds of images came in, from Hampstead Heath <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1570958">w</a></sup>, near where I spent my childhood, and also of Vancouver, and this poem also was published in TISH <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2384384">w</a></sup>, a publication from those Vancouver days.
David Bromige	00:22:52	Reads "We Could Get a Drink" from The Gathering.
David Bromige	00:24:57	I'll read a few poems now from the book between--that was from a book called The Gathering. This is from The Ends of the Earth. And these, in their literal presence, these woods were the woods behind Deep Cove <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5250114">w</a></sup>, where I was living in 1964, just up from Vancouver.
David Bromige	00:25:24	Reads "In Deep Woods" from The Ends of the Earth.

David Bromige	00:29:25	Reads "A Call" [from The Ends of the Earth].
David Bromige	00:30:35	This is a...it's my own attempt to write a fairy story. And I just let come into it all the elements that I knew from various fairy stories, narrative tricks and devices and so forth, and tried to have my fun from them, but I didn't get away with it. They took me, even though I held off, as well as I could.
David Bromige	00:31:03	Reads "A Final Mission" [from The Ends of the Earth].
Audience	00:38:04	Applause.
David Bromige	00:38:11	That's the closest, I guess, to a political poem I've ever written. [Audience laughter]. So I want a bit to break that mood, because I can't do anything more with that mood.
David Bromige	00:38:23	Reads "A Kind Numbness" [from The Ends of the Earth].
David Bromige	00:39:19	I like that very much, that notion of the bargain by which we civilized beings live, it comes through for me very strongly there, but also, I mean when the sun gets up the flies get up, but also that you can focus on one or the other. Let's see how I'm doing for time. Okay, I'll read...I sent the manuscript of Threads off to the publisher about two months ago, and these are the poems I've written since then.
