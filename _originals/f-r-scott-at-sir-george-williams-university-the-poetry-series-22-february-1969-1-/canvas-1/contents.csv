F.R. Scott	00:00:00	Ladies and gentleman, the poems I'm going to read stretch over a period, it seems hard to believe, of about 45 years, and the writing of poetry has changed quite as much in that time as the world has changed, and probably for the same reason. Some of the poems I start with, you are actually going to hear a rhyme, and they're going to be structured. And you won't appreciate it, but some are going to vary the rhyme form in a way which, when they were written, seemed really quite daring. And I have witnessed, and as poets go on, it will always happen, this continuous evolution of the method--the method of expression and the forms of expression, that the poet, like any other artist, uses. I'm going to start at the beginning of my writing, I was born in Quebec City <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2145">w</a></sup>, grew up there. The Laurentian mountains <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q75596">w</a></sup> are ten miles away, my father was a great lover of nature, we went into the country for picnics all the time, he used to put me at the edge of the mountains and say "Frank, look North, there's nothing between you and the North Pole". And after I'd been three and a half years at Oxford <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34433">w</a></sup> and in Europe <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46">w</a></sup>, soaking up nothing up but human history, the background and fundamentals of our civilization, I came back to Montreal <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340">w</a></sup>, which seemed an incredibly ugly, empty, valueless city. The one thing that matched the power of the European tradition was this North land. It's emptiness, it's waiting. So I remember poems touching upon that feeling, and I will read first, this poem is really 45 years old, "New Names".

F.R. Scott	00:08:09	And in the same vein, here is a street cry modeled on the street cries of London <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q84">w</a></sup> when they were selling--women were selling on the streets--"Street Cry".
F.R. Scott	00:08:34	Reads "Street Cry".
F.R. Scott	00:09:03	One sees this north land, subject to man's invasion. This is called "Laurentian Shield" <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76034">w</a></sup>, which as you know, the name of the geological formation that covers most of the northern part of this country.

F.R. Scott	00:12:27	And "Flying to Fort Smith". I went down the Mackenzie river <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3411">w</a></sup> and flew from Edmonton <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2096">w</a></sup> to Fort Smith <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q686415">w</a></sup> over the Peace River <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2220">w</a></sup> and these other rivers underneath which wind through the flat plain.

F.R. Scott	00:19:19	Here's another recent poem, called "On the Terrace, Quebec". You imagine yourself on the terrace of Chateau Frontenac <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q745964">w</a></sup> looking at the basin.

F.R. Scott	00:21:28	"A Grain of Rice", a poem I wrote in Burma <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q836">w</a></sup>, thinking of the Korean war <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8663">w</a></sup>, seeing the monsoon rains, reflecting on man and the universe in which he lives.

F.R. Scott	00:29:25	And now, one or two more found poems. The first is from the Canadian Indian Pavilion at Expo <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1344988">w</a></sup>. And it is found in this way, and those of you that saw that pavilion remember that they had these various rooms and in each room they had one or two lines of statements, up on the wall, about themselves and their relations with the white man. And all I did was to collect these various statements from a number of rooms and put them together to make a single poem, and it goes like this, I call it "The Indians Speak at Expo 67".
F.R. Scott	00:30:24	Reads "The Indians Speak at Expo 67".
F.R. Scott	00:31:44	In one of those rooms, there was a treaty between the British Crown and some Indian Chiefs. These treaties all had one purpose: they were to transfer valuable lands to Indians to the white man. And the treaties I may say always succeeded. This treaty was written out in a very formal manuscript, and the Indians had got hold of the original parchment, or whatever it was on, and they had blown it up to a great big thing they had up on the wall. The treaty was signed by two chiefs, signed--that is to say--the chiefs could not sign their names and presumably could not read the treaty, but they made little drawings, marks, to indicate that they had approved, and this what part of the treaty contains. There was a signature at the top, Chief Ningaram and at the bottom, Chief Wobumingwam.

F.R. Scott	00:34:07	And about 30,000 acres of the richest land in Southern Ontario <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1904">w</a></sup> went for a song to the chiefs who couldn't sign their names. And I just came across the other day, in a book that I picked up, another thing I think I could call a 'found poem', also by the Indians, it's in The Life of McGillivray, the great fur trader of Montreal and his North West Company <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1142049">w</a></sup>, you know in the early part of the last century, around 1810-20. This is an account of the North West Company, describing how they relate themselves to the Indians, and you will see the philanthropy.
