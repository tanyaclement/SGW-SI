Roy Kiyooka	00:00:00	Ladies and Gentleman, um, let's see, what am I going to say? [Audience laughter and applause]...Well, glad to see y’all here. So, Professor Louis Dudek []https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3261787] from McGill University <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201492">w</a></sup> will introduce the two poets who’re reading this evening. 
Audience	00:00:31	Applause.
Louis Dudek	00:00:40	I expected a longer introduction than that, it will be very fine. There are two kinds of readings that I like to attend very much, one kind is the sort that they're having tonight at McGill University, where a well-established poet who has been on the scene for forty or fifty years comes to read. Over there, it's A.J.M. Smith <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4647944">w</a></sup> from Michigan State <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270222">w</a></sup>, Canadian anthologist and well-known poet. With a poet like that, really makes no difference what he reads or how he reads it's just important to see him and even the tottering saint can perform miracles on occasions. The other kinds of poets I do like to hear very much are the sort that we'll hear tonight, Gnarowski and Beissel <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1606507">w</a></sup>. The McGill publicity department sent out a notice about A.J.M. Smith and described him as well-known Anthropologist of Canadian poetry. Actually, they corrected it in ink, they made the mistake twice though, probably a typist error. But they didn't know how correct they were, with the current scene in Canadian writing, there are primitive types around that are hard to classify and we need anthropologists...Well, Beissel and Gnarowski are not of this breed of poets who seem to have lost all sense of poetic organization or form, where you think that conventions, poetic conventions have been abolished and what is left are chaotic bits of internal monologue on the page. Of course, that kind of school may be very interesting to watch to see what comes out of it but at present, having watched it now for a few years I'm a little impatient often and tired of the magazines where this material occurs because it seems so easy to turn out and anyone has these bits of chaotic monologue going on. On the other hand, there are many poets still writing who are not following the conventional forms of English metrics and rhyme and so forth, who are turning out poems or at least watching what happens what happens with the words on the page and both the poets we're listening to tonight are of this kind. They are very careful craftsmen. Henry Beissel has the long list of achievements to his credits already, but two on that list strike me very much. One is, amongst many of the posts where he's taught, one is the University of Alberta <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q640694">w</a></sup> is the kind of political stir that was created on the campus when his magazine Edge was brought into the classroom by one of the professors. That is, his poetry contains, content that can make one think, that is morally committed to certain issues in today's world. He's very strongly a moral poet on one side, and the other item in his biography is his new book which has just appeared New Wings for Icarus, which is extremely aesthetic at the same time that it is meaningful in this way. His poetry seems to combine two things, one is a moral urgency and on the other hand, at the same time, a romantic sense of language and of imagery and of emotion that goes with that, which are all very, very promising characteristics for a beginning poet, but I think that this New Wings for Icarus book is his first considerable book. So, without more ado, I introduce to you Henry Beissel. 
Henry Beissel	00:05:30	When I considered the kind of poems that I might read this evening and the order in which to read them, I was thinking of the condition of this hall, as it was the last time I was here and I therefore chose two poems which I wrote in the West Indies <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q669037">w</a></sup>. [Audience laughter]. They celebrate the sun in an ambiguous sort of way, I'm going to read them all the same, despite the fact that the conditions have changed. I don't know how much you need to know about the West Indies, I'm hoping—oh.
Audience Member 1	00:06:15	Addresses Beissel [unintelligible].
Henry Beissel	00:06:17	Is this any better? Is there someone in the hall who can attend please to all this? 
Audience Member 2	00:06:28	Addresses Beissel [unintelligible].
Audience	00:06:30	Laughter.
Henry Beissel	00:06:39	Well I'll try to speak a little louder on my own, in spite of the microphone. I was saying that I don't know how much one needs to know of the West Indies to respond to this sort of poem, I'm hoping something of the West Indies might be in the poems, the first is called "Pans at Carnival". Pan <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6610630">w</a></sup> is the expression for a steel drum. The imagery in the poem is taken entirely from the steel drum and its use at Carnival <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4618">w</a></sup>, a feast that is about to be celebrated in Trinidad <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q754">w</a></sup> in about a month. Rhythmically, the poem tries to catch something of the rhythm of the steel pan. 
Henry Beissel	00:07:28	Reads "Pans at Carnival".
Henry Beissel	00:10:18	The second poem celebrates something of the violence that the sun, with which the sun blesses those parts of the world from which it never really disappears.
Henry Beissel	00:10:34	Reads "Where the Sun Only".
Henry Beissel	00:12:49	Next I want to read two parts from New Wings for Icarus. Time does not allow me to read the whole poem, because then I could read you nothing else. “Icarus” is a poem that is written in four parts, it is with some regret that I read only two, because to me it is like playing the second and fourth part of a symphony, but there is no alternative. 
Henry Beissel	00:13:19	Reads "New Wings for Icarus", part 2 from New Wings for Icarus.
Henry Beissel	00:13:51	Sorry, I'll start again. This is a hard one to read and this print is very small. I better hold it closer.
Henry Beissel	00:13:59	Reads "New Wings for Icarus", part 2 from New Wings for Icarus.
Henry Beissel	00:19:41	Reads "New Wings for Icarus", part 4 from New Wings for Icarus.
Henry Beissel	00:26:39	Now for a little sort of relaxation in-between, I find unrelieved serious poetry hard to bear myself, I'll read—unfortunately I do not write occasional poems terribly often, they always seem to grow into something much bigger than I can handle, but the next two poems I want to read you are occasional poems, poetry can come out of anything of course, and this one came out of an encounter in a house of Inquisition in Cartagena <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q657461">w</a></sup>, in Colombia <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739">w</a></sup>, it is really self-explanatory. It's called "En la Casa de Inquisición". 
Henry Beissel	00:27:40	Reads "En la Casa de Inquisición".
Henry Beissel	00:29:23	The next poem leads me on to the last set of poems, but you won't discover that until you hear the last two poems. This poem is dedicated to my daughter, when she was 1 and a half, the first stanza deals with the circumstances of her birth, which were somewhat elaborate, there were firemen. The second stanza deals with her present—this would be the past from the time of the poem, the second deals with her present, and the third with her future. 
Henry Beissel	00:30:07	Reads "To My Daughter at Age 1 1/2".
Henry Beissel	00:33:25	And now I come to the final two poems. They belong together and are part of a— we agreed not to torture you and not to read for more than 30 minutes this evening and I am trying to stick to that. This is rather the beginning of something that I may never live to finish, the entire thing is supposed to have some 26 poems, of which you will hear the first two, one is a prologue and the other one is called "Adam Enter Eve". In the prologue, a character introduces himself who is to play his part in the rest of the poem. It's not really a dramatic poem, although it's, well I don't think of it as a drama, although it has dramatic qualities. Anyway, I don't like to be my own critic. I prefer just to read you the poem. The whole cycle will be called "The Dancer from the Dance" that is as you no doubt know, a quotation from Yeats <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213">w</a></sup>. 
Henry Beissel	00:34:45	Reads "Prologue" from "The Dancer from the Dance".
Henry Beissel	00:37:04	Reads "Adam Enter Eve".
