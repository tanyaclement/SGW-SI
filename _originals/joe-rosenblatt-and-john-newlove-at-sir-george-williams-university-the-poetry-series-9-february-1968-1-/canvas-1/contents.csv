Roy Kiyooka	00:00:00	Good evening. Hello, Mr. Bowering <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1239280">w</a></sup>. [Audience laughter]. Well, welcome to the sixth reading of our second series of evenings with Canadian and American poets. Tonight we have Joe Rosenblatt <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1691575">w</a></sup>, Toronto <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172">w</a></sup>, and John Newlove <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6250356">w</a></sup>, formerly of Vancouver <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24639">w</a></sup>, now residing in Nova Scotia <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1952">w</a></sup>. Joe Rosenblatt will begin the reading, there will be an intermission, and John Newlove will follow. I'm going to quote largely from the copy in Joe Rosenblatt's book, The LSD Leacock, for I hope servient biographical information. It goes like this, he was born in Toronto on December the 26th, nineteen hundred and thirty-three. He says that he has suffocated in Toronto ever since then. He attended the Central Technical School <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5061898">w</a></sup> and dropped out in Grade 10, he has worked as a grave-digger, plumber's helper, civil servant, railway express misanthrope. He has attended the Provincial Institute of Trades where he acquired a diploma as a welder fitter, his favourite writers are Ambrose Biers, William Blake <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513">w</a></sup>, Emily Dickinson <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4441">w</a></sup>, and A.M. Klein <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2778027">w</a></sup>, and his favourite dream, is Cyclops turning up at a [nigh-bank (?)]. [Audience laughter]. His previous book of poems, which was probably printed in nineteen hundred and sixty-three, is called Voyage of the Mood. Joe Rosenblatt.
Audience	00:02:27	Applause.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:02:36	Wasn't that [unintelligible]. I'm just going to read, start off with a series of poems I had written about my uncle, who was a fishmonger. He had a habit of phyxiating and murdering fish, and slicing them, and slicing them, and...well, I'll start. This is called "Uncle Nathan: Blessed his memory, speaketh in land-locked green".
Joe Rosenblatt	00:03:11	Reads "Uncle Nathan: Blessed his memory, speaketh in land-locked green" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Audience	00:06:10	Applause.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:06:16	"Ichthycide". Another poem about my uncle. It's funny, really. [Audience laughter].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:06:29	Reads "Ichthycide" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Audience	00:08:05	Laughter and applause .
Joe Rosenblatt	00:08:13	This is called "A Shell Game". Has to do with my uncle. [Audience laughter]. It's about his funeral.  Joke.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:08:27	Reads "A Shell Game [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:09:42	I wrote all kinds of poems. I was in Vancouver and I came across the god-awful logic of the zoo. It kinda scared the hell out of me. It was a bat. I've never seen a bat before. Met people who were bats. But this was the real McCoy, it was a fruit bat and it was hanging upside-down, you know, that's the way they live and they fornicate that way too, apparently, upside-down. So I wrote about bats. I have some more fish poems but I get tired of that after a while, you start hating it. And we'll begin with "Bats". While it's true the bat is a mammal, not a bird, there's all types of kinds of mythology based on prejudice about bats and which I've tried to embody in these poems. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:10:47	Reads "Bats" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:11:32	Outside of the bat poem there came a group of sound poetry. Because I tried to get the feeling of the bat in the air, you know the image of the bat and the way it, and the movements of the bat. And this is called "The Fruit Bat". First encounter with a bat.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:11:56	Reads "The Fruit Bat" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:13:16	This is better. This is “The Bat Cage”.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:13:19	Reads “The Bat Cage” [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:14:39	Oh we're like bats to people. We used to have, I used to, when I was a kid I went to school and we had a music teacher who was a bit of a nut. She used to rap kids across the knuckles, you know, just to hear them singing. [Audience laughter]. I may have called her Mrs. Love, I can't recall, the trauma was too great. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:15:02	Reads “The Vampire” [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Audience	00:15:48	Laughter and applause.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:15:55	"The Zombie". Just whistle when you get tired of these bat poems. Do anything you wanna do. "The Zombie". By the way, bats are supposed to be unkosher according to Leviticus <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41490">w</a></sup>. It says all fowl that creep going upon all fours shall be an abomination unto you. But in other countries they're great appetizers, the fruit bat especially, and I have an interesting poem, not right now though. "The Zombie".
Joe Rosenblatt	00:16:26	Reads "The Zombie" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:17:59	I'll read one more bat poem, it's the sound thing, an experimental thing which I later developed...too many of these bats here. I wrote a Christmas poem on bats, too. Maybe I should read it. Dedicated to somebody. I'll read the sound poem. It's more important. "The Butterfly Bat". There is a butterfly bat. Hm, found in the Orient, a very beautiful bat, orange apparently, very beautiful though. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:18:43	Reads "The Butterfly Bat" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:20:02	Reads "Orpheus in Stanley Park" [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:20:50	"Sex and Death". This poem's for a friend of mine. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:20:54	Reads "Sex and Death" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:21:48	I should read the egg poems, because I don't think many of you have heard them, and I'll do that. You'd probably like them better than the bats. More meaningful. This is called "Egg Sonata".
Joe Rosenblatt	00:22:20	Reads "Egg Sonata" [from The LSD Leacock].
Audience	00:23:38	Laughter and applause.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:23:44	Reads ["Let the egg live" (?)].
Unknown	00:24:56	Silence [cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:24:59	Reads "It's in the egg, in the little round egg" [from The LSD Leacock].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:26:57	One more egg poem. [Audience laughter and applause]. This is a prose poem. It's called "The Easter I got for Passover". [Audience laughter]. It has to do with an argument, whether the body of Christ did not go to heaven, the moderator of the United Church of Canada <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q198745">w</a></sup> said yesterday, Right Reverend Ernest Marshall Howes told a press conference that he does not believe in the physical resurrection of Jesus but does believe in a spiritual resurrection. That's from the Globe and Mail <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43148750">w</a></sup>, 23rd of April, '65.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:27:46	Reads "The Easter I got for Passover" [from The LSD Leacock].
Audience	00:30:02	Applause. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:30:10	Do you want to read, John? Where is he? [Audience laughter]. Do you want me to come here? Yeah, okay. I'm getting down to my dirty poems, what am I going to do? I wrote a whole bunch of pornographic poetry, right. I'll read that for the end when the time's up. I wrote a poem to Che Guevara <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5809">w</a></sup>, if I can find the thing now, because I really muddled everything up here, oh here it is. It's called "The Beehive: An Elegy to Che Guevara".
Joe Rosenblatt	00:30:52	Reads "The Beehive: An Elegy to Che Guevara" [from Winter of the Luna Moth]. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:31:42	A poem about a critic, “Fable”.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:31:47	Reads “Fable” [from Winter of the Luna Moth].  
Joe Rosenblatt	00:32:37	I wrote another one about a critic, a friend of mine. It's called "The Crab Louse". I'll read it. [Audience laughter]. I think some of you may recognize him. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:32:47	Reads "The Crab Louse".
Joe Rosenblatt	00:33:25	Reads "The Fire Bug Poet".
Joe Rosenblatt	00:34:29	"How Mice Make Love," how'd this get in here? "How Mice Make Love".
Joe Rosenblatt	00:34:36	Reads "How Mice Make Love" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:35:29	"The Electric Rose".
Joe Rosenblatt	00:35:34	Reads "The Electric Rose" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Audience	00:37:13	Applause.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:37:17	Should I read on? Well this is a poem called "Itch". It's about that cat who, you know, in the world of the dead. And as usual I mucked up all the mythology, but it was too late to change the poem. So I said, what the hell. 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:37:44	Reads "Itch" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:41:51	There's a loathsome typographical error in here. That's what happens.
Joe Rosenblatt	00:41:56	Resumes reading "Itch" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:43:20	[Unintelligible] a more cheerful poem, if I can find one here. How about "Cricket Love"? I'll read one very early poem I wrote, "Better She Dressed in a Black Garment". 
Joe Rosenblatt	00:43:39	Reads "Better She Dressed in a Black Garment" [from Winter of the Luna Moth].
Joe Rosenblatt	00:44:21	Thank you. 
Audience	00:44:22	Applause.
Roy Kiyooka	00:44:35	There'll be a fifteen minute inter- [cut off abruptly].
