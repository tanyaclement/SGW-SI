Charles Simic	00:00:00	I was asking [Ksemi Rothers (?)] about, you know, who are my great grand-uncles, and great-grandfathers and so on, and I found out that they all were killed or disappeared in some completely forgotten nineteenth-century Balkan wars which no one knows anymore the cause or the reason or why they were started. And so this poem kind of happened out of that. It's called "Marching". 
Charles Simic 	00:00:47	Reads "Marching" from Dismantling the Silence.
Charles Simic	00:03:28	This is a kind of a, you could say that it's sort of an elegy for my father, in seven parts.
Charles Simic	00:03:47	Reads “George Simic” [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].
Charles Simic	00:07:44	This is a love poem. I have a series of love poems in the new book but this is one of them. And I might use the title of this poem as the title of the new book. The title is "Return to a place lit by a glass of milk".
Charles Simic	00:08:08	Reads "Return to a place lit by a glass of milk" [published later in Return to a place lit by a glass of milk].
Charles Simic	00:09:20	I want to read a couple more poems now. "Dismantling the Silence".
Charles Simicn	00:09:54	Reads "Dismantling the Silence" from Dismantling the Silence.
Charles Simic	00:11:17	The last poem in this book is called "Errata" for the good reason that after I finished the book I felt again, you know, a sense of frustration. I didn't say everything. And so each of the lines in this particular poem are really, refer to actual lines in the book. I'm kind of correcting myself. "Errata".
Charles Simic	00:11:53	Reads "Errata" from Dismantling the Silence.
Charles Simic	00:13:20	Thank you.  
Audience	00:13:23	Applause.
Introducer	00:13:35	The next reading will be on January 14th. Dorothy Livesay <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1250325">w</a></sup> will read that night.
