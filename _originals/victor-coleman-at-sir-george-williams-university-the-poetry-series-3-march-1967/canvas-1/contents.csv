Victor Coleman	00:02:49	I like to make it a habit always at a reading to start off with something that somebody else wrote, simply to show you that my concerns lie elsewhere, then in my own self. This is something from A History of America by an American writer by the name of Bill Hutton and it's— well, I won't explain it to you.
Victor Coleman	00:03:35	Reads unnamed poem by Bill Hutton.
Victor Coleman	00:06:00	I'll read a few short poems first, and then go into something from a sequence, a longer sequence. This is a poem dedicated to Bill Hutton, the author of that piece I just read, it's called "Buff Hello, 6".
Victor Coleman	00:06:33	Reads "Buff Hello, 6".
Victor Coleman	00:08:27	I'm going to focus on that clock every once in a while, simply because I want to keep track of myself. If I might say, um, it's interesting that I'm reading with George Bowering and my general tenure at this time, uh, which I'm not really that self-conscious about which is interesting to me to be growing a beard at this time and that the last time that I started to grow a beard was the first time that I met George Bowering and it was about two years ago and we were sitting up in my attic which was a room and I said to him, "How do you like my beard?" and he says that "It makes you look like an impotent D.H. Lawrence <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34970">w</a></sup>”. [Audience laughter]. This is a poem called "The Lady Vanishes".
Victor Coleman	00:09:41	Reads "The Lady Vanishes".
Victor Coleman	00:11:14	Here's a kind of poem that I can bug everybody with because it probably won't mean anything to you at all, but simply because it really is my occasion but rather than hide it away, um, I think that the sound of it is enough to carry to you, some measure of the poetry that I got from the occasion that I speak of. It's called "For Basil Bunting".
Victor Coleman	00:11:48	Reads "For Basil Bunting".
Victor Coleman	00:12:34	I don't know whether any of you are familiar with a Japanese-English dictionary called Kenkyusha <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6389422">w</a></sup>, if not, all I can tell you is that it's a Japanese-English dictionary and that it has a strange quality to be able to predict the future, by chance operations in that it's very fat and you open it and you're like the guy with the funny hat at the track who really shouldn't be there because he can only guess and he just opens the racing form and sticks his finger on the horse and he bets on the horse and he usually loses. Kenkyusha is a little better than that because you're not trying to win anything, you're looking for some kind of instruction and the time I wrote these poems I was rather desperate for some kind of instruction, and uh, it's just a matter of opening the book, pointing and getting the epigraph for each poem from the Japanese-English dictionary. I'll just read a couple. "Day Seven", oh there are given days, that are sort of daily devotions.
Victor Coleman	00:14:09	Reads "Day Seven".
Victor Coleman	00:14:33	Reads "Day Eight".
Victor Coleman	00:15:19	Reads "Day Ten".
Victor Coleman	00:16:18	Many of these relate to certain experiences with LSD also.
Victor Coleman	00:16:29	Reads "Day Thirteen".
Victor Coleman	00:16:49	The reason that the definitions, the English definitions in this section are so interesting and not like the ones we are accustomed to is because the characters that they represent go through their own changes and it's almost an ideogrammatic dictionary rather than a dictionary of definitions.
Victor Coleman	00:17:13	Resumes reading “Day Thirteen”.
Victor Coleman	00:20:17	I need to get one of those spider clocks, can't read in this light.
Victor Coleman	00:20:39	Reads "Day Twenty-One" .
Victor Coleman	00:22:36	Reads "Day Twenty-Two".
Victor Coleman	00:24:56	Reads "Day Twenty-Four".
Victor Coleman	00:28:22	These next poems are the poems that are closest to me now. It's another long sequence called "Separations" and I don't think I need to give you any background on it. I'll not read the whole thing because it's quite long.
Victor Coleman	00:28:56	Reads "Separations” [parts 4-8, 10-12, and 14].
Victor Coleman	00:37:00	Thank you.
