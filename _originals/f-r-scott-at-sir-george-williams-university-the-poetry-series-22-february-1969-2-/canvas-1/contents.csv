F.R. Scott	00:15:23	And finally, a poem called "A l'ange avant-gardien". It seems strange, but I was brought up to believe there was a guardian angel, un ange gardien, looking after me, so you felt a little more secure. As you know, there are certain places in this province called l'ange gardien. So I thought of the avant, l'ange avant-gardien. Stevens had a necessary angel, which to him was reality. Many people have angels, but this challenging avant-garde angel always asking you to be in the avant=garde, seems to me what I was thinking about. "A l'ange avant-gardien".
