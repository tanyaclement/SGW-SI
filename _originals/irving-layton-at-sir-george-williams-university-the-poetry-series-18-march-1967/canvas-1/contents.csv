Audience	00:02:21	Applause.
Irving Layton	00:02:30	Thank you Howard, for your kind introduction. I'm glad that you did not introduce me as a letter writer. I'm very glad to see so large a turn out this evening. I am very heartened by it, very moved, and I'm very glad to see so many of my friends and former students in the audience. I like beginning my reading with a poem "There Are No Signs" because if any one poem expresses what I try to say, and all the poems and stories that I have written, is that modern man, pretty well, has to find out where he is going, by just going. Now the old sign posts are down, and that he must make his sign posts as he goes along.
Irving Layton	00:04:00	Reads "There Are No Signs" [published as “There Were No Signs in Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:04:51	"The Swimmer", my symbol for the poet, condemned to live in two realms, and happy to live in neither of them. The realm of actuality and the realm of the imagination. Here I compare the poet to the swimmer.
Irving Layton	00:05:15	Reads "The Swimmer" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:06:38	Several years ago I taught at the Jewish Library, one of my students was a Mrs. Fornheim, who had lived in Vienna <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1741">w</a></sup>, and left Vienna when that city fell to the Nazis. She went to Paris <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90">w</a></sup>, and left Paris for Spain <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29">w</a></sup>, when the Vichy government was formed. From Spain, she went to Portugal <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q45">w</a></sup> and then came to Montreal <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340">w</a></sup>, where I taught her English. She died of cancer, this is my poem for her. "Mrs. Fornheim, Refugee".
Irving Layton	00:07:19	Reads "Mrs. Fornheim, Refugee" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:08:12	"Gothic Landscape", or what it means to be a Jewish boy growing up in a hostile neighbourhood of French Canadians and Italians who are convinced that you have lately murdered Christ. And where you are entranced by the church bells every Sunday, because of the ecstatic music over the sky, over the rooftops, and yet, in that ecstatic music of the bells, a sound of menace, something alien and frightening.
Irving Layton	00:09:00	Reads "Gothic Landscape" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:10:19	"The Black Huntsmen". This was written at a time when Jewish skin was made into lampshades. Or, the song of innocence becoming the song of experience.
Irving Layton	00:10:42	Reads "The Black Huntsmen" [from Collected Poems].
Unknown	00:12:07	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
Irving Layton	00:12:08	This is how the fringes of a prayer shawl, a sheitel is a wig. If you are an Orthodox, Jewess as my mother was, you have to cut your hair very short and wear a wig so that you are no longer attractive so to speak, to any other man but your husband. Peculiar way of looking at it.
Irving Layton	00:12:43	Reads "Archetypes" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:13:38	Reads "Soleil de Noces" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:14:15	"De Bullion Street". I don't suppose De Bullion Street has the reputation that it had when I was a boy. I suppose the present administration has cleaned up things, and anyway harlots now are more peripatetic. So this, in a sense, is an old fashioned poem.
Irving Layton	00:14:40	Reads "De Bullion Street" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:16:10	"On My Way To School" or the changes that come. I wasn't the most punctual of students, and it's a great comfort to me therefore when I was late to find a sign on a Baptist church "Jesus Saves". Many years, I returned and found some change had taken place and this poem celebrates the change, or records it.
Irving Layton	00:16:44	Reads "On My Way To School" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:17:20	Reads "Love the Conqueror Worm" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:18:31	"Vexata Quaestio". Western man is the product we are told, of two traditions, the Greek, and the Hebrew. The Greek, pagan, believing that all experience is worth having, and man should refuse no experience. The Hebrew believing that the proper life, salvation is to be found in obedience to God's will. The two traditions are quite contradictory and can never be reconciled. It is our unfortunate destiny to try to reconcile them. I do not think we have been successful at it because the task cannot be done, it's impossible. So I've written this poem, "Vexata Quaestio" and what I'm saying is that each and every one of us in the West is a sort of compromise between these two traditions. Here I use the tree, a tall tree, as a symbol for the Hebraic, the Maccabean and the sun becomes a symbol for the pagan, and you'll see what happens to both the tree and the sun.
Irving Layton	00:20:11	Reads "Vexata Quaestio" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:21:19	"Cemetery in August". Only humans of course are aware of death, and even in August, when you feel the flush and thrill and intensity of life, you are aware of the autumn and the winter and when you are in a cemetery, the macabre juxtaposition of life and death becomes even more intense. So I wrote this poem, "Cemetery in August".
Irving Layton	00:21:54	Reads "Cemetery in August" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:24:20	"To the Girls of my Graduating Class". This was a graduating class, not at Sir George Williams, but my high school I taught several years ago. And I was very fortunate one year in having six very, very lovely, nubile adolescents, very attractive, and very, very well aware of precisely where attractions lay [audience laughter]. And very often when I was in the middle of a serious lecture in history, one of them would make some provocative gesture that would drive my thoughts from the lecture to something far more interesting [audience laughter].
Irving Layton	00:25:15	Reads "To the Girls of my Graduating Class" [from Collected Poems].
Audience	00:26:30	Laughter.
Irving Layton	00:26:33	And what you see when you are in the tavern, the kind of dreams you have about pleasure and about the strange, the strange dance that all of us lead. And this very queer life and journey of ours. And I call this "Bacchanal", and it's a rather unusual Bacchanal, because it's a rather sad one, or shall I say a prayerful one.
Irving Layton	00:27:10	Reads "Bacchanal" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:28:18	This one is for my son, "Maxie".
Irving Layton	00:28:24	Reads "Maxie" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:30:03	And I suppose all teachers of literature have had the experience of giving an inspired lecture on Shakespeare <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692">w</a></sup> or John Donne <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q140412">w</a></sup>, and finding some hand at the back waving furiously as you're getting to the home stretch and your peroration is the most resounding thing that you've ever thought about but this hand out there, very insistent, you know, and finally you stop in the middle of the peroration and you say "Yes, yes what is it?" and the student says, "Sir, will this be on the exam?" [audience laughter].
Irving Layton	00:30:57	Reads "Seven o'Clock Lecture" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:34:07	"The Birth of Tragedy". The title is taken from one of the earliest books of Nietzsche <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9358">w</a></sup>, the gods here that I speak about in the poem, are the gods of Dream and Dance, of Reason and Ecstasy, Apollo and Dionysus, Nietzsche held that tragedy came from the union of both dream and dance, intellect and impulse.
Irving Layton	00:34:44	Reads "The Birth of Tragedy" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:36:44	And I suppose no Layton reading would be quite complete without this poem, "Misunderstanding".
Irving Layton	00:36:54	Reads "Misunderstanding" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:37:16	"The Cold Green Element". This is about life, death, nature, and poetry. It's really a meditation, and, I hope, a passionate meditation on art and life. Like Yeats <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40213">w</a></sup>, I am very concerned with the necessary antinomies or contradictions of life. Like Yeats, I believe that great art results from the happy, the miraculous fusion of the two.
Irving Layton	00:38:04	Reads "The Cold Green Element" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:40:20	"The Improved Binoculars", my symbol for science. It is truism to say that unless man's moral development, his capacity for sympathy, keeps space, or this development in science and technology he's in danger of blowing himself off the face of this earth. This poem is an apocalyptic poem, it is a vision of the future, such as I hope will never be realized. But in one of my more despairing moments, or one of my more savage and bitter moments, I wrote this poem, "The Improved Binoculars".
Irving Layton	00:41:05	Reads "The Improved Binoculars" [from Collected Poems].

Irving Layton	00:47:14	"Song for Naomi". Naomi's my daughter. Several years ago we were out in the country, I was appalled to find that while she was by the bank of the lake, I couldn't see her because the weeds and the flowers were taller than she was. If she fell into the lake, neither I nor my wife might see it. But nothing happened. Just a day before we were to pack up to leave, I noticed my daughter down by the lake, and this time, her dear little head was peeping just above the weeds and the flowers and this gave me the idea for this poem, which I wrote, while of course my wife did the packing.
Irving Layton	00:48:12	Reads "Song for Naomi" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:49:47	Here's a rather erotic poem, called "Gathering of Poets", to be taken of course with a grain of salt.
Unknown	00:49:59	[Cut or edit made in tape].
Irving Layton	00:50:00	...to be taken, of course, with a grain of salt. Just a short thing.

Irving Layton	00:53:19	And here's a lighter poem called "Bargain".

Audience	00:53:46	Laughter.
Irving Layton	00:53:58	This next poem is for my mother, who died at the age of 89. She was a very remarkable woman, I'd like to tell you a great deal about her, she certainly merits it, she was a most remarkable character with a tremendous joie-de-vivre and a wonderful gift of vituperation, which it is said I have inherited [audience laughter]. Certainly I learned the cadence of poetry from my mother's cursing. My mother would start cursing as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning and wouldn't stop cursing until I closed them at night when I went to bed. But the cadence was what interested me [audience laughter] and I didn't pay any attention to words. Occasionally I would get the drift, of course, of what the curses were intended to say, and I must say it did me a wonderful lot of good because later on when I got knocked my critics and so on, it was like so much water off a duck's back after my mother's cursing. Nothing the critics say could possibly make any impression upon me whatsoever [audience laughter]. She was extremely vain of her black eyebrows. When she was 85, I was taking her somewhere and we stopped for a red light. I noticed a very lovely girl standing on the curb, and of course, I looked very intently at her. My mother caught my intent gaze and said, sighing, "Yes, she's very beautiful, but has she got my black eyebrows?" [audience laughter]. She wore earrings that were made of old Romanian coins, she wore an amber necklace, which I remember playing with when I was a child. But it was her immense vitality and joie-de-vivre, coupled with an immense discontent that always fascinated me about my mother. She was a very Orthodox woman, reverencing God, but often giving me the impression that she might have made a much better job of creation than God himself. So this is my tribute to my very, very remarkable mother.

Irving Layton	00:59:16	Reads "The Well-Wrought Urn" [from Collected Poems].
Irving Layton	00:59:57	Some time ago, I went down to the church at Notre Dame, and you know, you have halos lighting up over the head of your favourite saint, or the Virgin Mary, if you drop the requisite number of coins. There's nobody else in that vast gloomy church, except another man and myself, and he went over to the little machine and he dropped some coins, and he waited for the halo to light up and it didn't. And that nettled him a great deal, and he waited, and it still didn't light up so he gave the machine a kick, nothing happened. But he said something and I went home and I wrote this poem.
Irving Layton	01:01:01	Reads "This Machine Age" [from Collected Poems; audience laughter throughout].
Irving Layton	01:02:09	This next poem of mine is also based on an actual experience, I'm sure that most of you have heard of Djilas <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q153909">w</a></sup>, the very courageous Yugoslav writer who's imprisoned by his erstwhile comrade and companion in arms, Tito. He's imprisoned for writing and publishing outside of the country, Conversations with Stalin <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5166446">w</a></sup>. That was several years ago, he's just been released. Well I thought a brave man like that deserves some kind of support, especially from and by writers, and so I decided to go up to Ottawa <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1930">w</a></sup> and demonstrate in front of the Yugoslav Embassy. I took my wife with me, and one or two of the local poets, we made some signs and we drove up to Ottawa. We got out of the car, and the sign read, of course, "Free Djilas", and I was amazed and delighted to find that a considerable crowd gathered around me and the sign. Until I realized just what was happening. And so I wrote this poem, called "Free Djilas".
Irving Layton	01:03:31	Reads "Free Djilas" [from Collected Poems; audience laughter throughout].
