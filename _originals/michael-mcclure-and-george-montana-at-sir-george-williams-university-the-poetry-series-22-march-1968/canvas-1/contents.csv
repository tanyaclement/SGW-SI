Audience	00:00:05	Applause.
Michael McClure	00:00:29	That was [unintelligible]. Star is a four letter word, s-t-a-r. Now, in case I read, I--is this on right? In case I read something here tonight with a four letter word in it, which I'm liable to cause I might start off be reading part of The Beard, um, [unintelligible] if anyone would be offended, it would be a good thing if they got their money back, right now. It's their right to do so.
Audience	00:01:07	Applause.
Michael McClure	00:01:22	The Beard is a poem of mine in the form of a play that's just been arrested fifteen nights in a row by Los Angeles <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q65">w</a></sup> police and a state law has been passed against it being performed in the state colleges in California <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q99">w</a></sup>. These are the trials and tribulations. And right now we're waiting for a panel of three federal judges to come and see it and decide if it has redeeming special significance. [Audience laughter]. And if they don't think it is, we'll take it to the Supreme Court <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11201">w</a></sup> and see what they think. And, the play has two characters in it, Billy the Kid <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44200">w</a></sup> and Jean Harlow <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105719">w</a></sup>. And they're together in a blue velvet eternity, they both are wearing little beards made out of torn white tissue paper. They're--they only thing on the set with them is a table and two chairs covered with furs and Harlow is wearing a blue gown and she has a purse with her and a mirror and the Kid is dressed in a costume appropriate to his costume--I mean appropriate to his career. And when the curtain opens, there's an orange light shining on him which goes up after the first, about the first thirty seconds. And being that this is a poem in the form of a play, I can only read it, I can't read it properly, I can't be two people, I can't be Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow I can only be the author so I'll have to read it that way where it's actually meant to be a poem and acted by me on a stage, on a shelf with lights. We have a shelf with lights, but that's the best I can do.
Michael McClure	00:03:41	Reads selection from The Beard.
Audience	00:10:29	Applause.
Michael McClure	00:11:02	Um, I'm going to read two more tonight. I want to read for a while and then have an intermission and then I'd like to come back on and play some musical pieces that my music guru George Montana has been working on with me and we've been writing some songs together, but I'd like to read poems for maybe half an hour or so first. I want to read some poems called "Mad Sonnets" and I imagine a lot of you know what sons are, what known as sons are, fourteen lines with a legitimate rhyme scheme, and these are not quite exactly like that...Does this microphone sound right? If I stand right here is that okay so that I don't have to lean into it?
Michael McClure	00:12:25	Reads "Mad Sonnet" [from Star].
Michael McClure	00:14:08	Another "Mad Sonnet", kind of ecological.
Michael McClure	00:14:23	Reads ["Mad Sonnet 3" from Star].
Michael McClure	00:16:03	Here's a--I live in San Francisco <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62">w</a></sup>, but here's a "Mad Sonnet" that I started in New York <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60">w</a></sup>, I went to Wall Street <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11690">w</a></sup> on a Saturday morning, I guess you can imagine what it's like during the weekdays, it's a narrow street, buildings stretching up like cliffs on each side of them and on Saturday morning it's cold and empty and you can feel the crush and vibrations from the previous part of the week.
Michael McClure	00:16:32	Reads [“Mad Sonnet 13” from Star, published later as “Cold Saturday Mad Sonnet” in Selected Poems].
Michael McClure	00:17:58	I never thought of those signs--they told me I can't smoke up here. It's my life. I'll do what I want, [unintelligible]. [Audience laughter]. The work--I think-are we all, I think I'm waiting for, this technology with which we live in, which is wonderful enough in it's own way, is also costly and [unintelligible], eating up the planet, and I think I'm waiting for an all-chemical science, by means in which we can manifest ourselves through the universe and I guess we'll have to tinker toys like rocket ships and space ships to begin it, but I don't think that's how we'll really do it. And it's become kind of tradition to write songs to science, so I guess I had to do one too.
Michael McClure	00:19:20	Reads [“Mad Sonnet 5” from Star].
Michael McClure	00:20:48	I've got a book of poems in a language I call Beast Language, they're about half in English and half in this invented language. The book is called Ghost Tantras, ghost like the German word "gist", g-i-s-t, which means spirit, and I just said "ghost". Why can't ghost be a spirit, why can't we use that in English? And tantra, t-a-n-t-r-a, which is a Hindu form of poetry, it's poetry written in an invented language for magical purposes to bring about changes in the universe. I felt these poems, I felt these poems coming on, and I felt like I had a ball of silence within myself, within my body and I heard these sounds within that ball of silence, and I wrote them down phonetically, so kind of like Marvel comics <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q173496">w</a></sup>, you know where it says "keee" or "rash", k-e-e-e, or r-a-s-h. And I see later that things like this have been done in gnostic Bizantine chants too, which also, is like Marvel comics. "Ka-pow". And some of them were written in San Francisco, some of them were written in airplanes, on the way to Mexico <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q96">w</a></sup>. I was going to Mexico to bring back cultures of [unintelligible] Mexicana, the sacred [salsavie (?)] mushroom which were grown by scientists in Brooklyn <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18419">w</a></sup>. And, then upon my return I finished from there. I finished these "Mad Sonnets", there are 99 of them and I don't think you've probably heard anything like them before, and I guess all you can do is just relax. I like to start with one that starts with English because it's not so strange, they're about a third English or half English maybe.
Michael McClure	00:23:15	Begins to perform unnamed sound poem.
Michael McClure	00:23:19	No, that's not it...Where'd George go? George? [Audience laughter].
Michael McClure	00:24:00	Performs “Ghost Tantra #51” [published later in Ghost Tantras].
Michael McClure	00:25:42	Here's another one that starts in English, it starts in Spanish. Just went to Spanish, [unintelligible] George is.
Michael McClure	00:25:57	Performs “Ghost Tantra #54” [published later in Ghost Tantras].
Michael McClure	00:27:45	I just had a lot of microphone trouble in Buffalo <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40435">w</a></sup> too. I don't know what. It's alright?
Michael McClure	00:27:55	Performs “Ghost Tantra #69” [published later in Ghost Tantras].
Michael McClure	00:29:45	Here's one, this was written the day after Marilyn Monroe <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4616">w</a></sup> died, August 6, 1962.
Michael McClure	00:30:11	Reads "Ghost Tantra #39" [published later in Ghost Tantras].
Michael McClure	00:31:37	You've got a tourist card in the back of the room [(?)] Is everybody relaxed? Cause I'm not. Eddie in [unintelligible] was dismissed recently and I guess this poem had something to do with it. And, the poem is the ending of, it's the sexual ending of a very long poem called "Dark Brown" I see nothing wrong in taking any sexual part of the poem from any other part of the poem, and the sexual writing today will be viewed in fifty years or a hundred years much the way we view nature poetry today in the 19th century, because some [unintelligible] classes we kept bringing up the fact that for our [unintelligible] today if you were to look at the atmosphere or the air we breathe, the primary part of our environment is either other human bodies or concrete and we choose human bodies rather than the concrete which seems to be a pretty good choice. I think that given the changes that are going on today, I believe we won't be able to say anything. If we can say anything now. If we can say anything anytime but I mean, I think this will be looked upon as [unintelligible] Nature poetry, Shelley <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93343">w</a></sup> and Keats <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q82083">w</a></sup>were pulling cockney school in their day, which of course was all there is for Shelley since he was a [unintelligible] and probably some of Keats although it was worse since he was a cockney. [Audience laughter]. They were insulted for their new nature poetries, and this too. I'd like to read some like, preliminary stanzas of that poem, and then read part of the longer section which seems to have to do with the [unintelligible]. In Eddie's defense I'll say that the London Times <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50008">w</a></sup> literary supplement found that this is [unintelligible]. The poem is written in independent stanzas, I'd like to think of the stanzas as being independent in the way an organism is, and the totality of the poem in the totality in a way an--the way a primitive--and this is a primitive organism is comprised of [unintelligible] individuals to make up its [unintelligible] of being. The poem is called "Dark Brown" and I've just opened it to the page I wanted to. The stanza I wanted to.
Michael McClure	00:35:21	Reads "Dark Brown" from Dark Brown.
Michael McClure	00:37:48	Reads ["The black black black damned and undreamy odem the undersoul" from Dark Brown].
Michael McClure	00:40:00	Another poem. Okay, have I justified enough? Now's your chance to go home. I'm going to read the tough part.
Michael McClure	00:40:23	Reads [“Fuck Ode” from Dark Brown].
Audience	00:50:00	Applause.
Michael McClure	00:50:15	I'll take a break. George and I are going to play, George Montana and I, and I won't guarantee anything about it as my fingers are feeling very clumsy tonight. I'll be playing an instrument but I know George will play for us, so if you hear any faults in the playing, it's me not George. I want to take like, at least, I want to take a ten minute break and anybody who'd like to stay is welcome to stay, and if you'd like to go, go, and if you want to leave during the music if you don't like the music for god's sake go. Thank you. 
Unknown	00:51:09	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
Michael McClure	00:51:12	I'm kind of nervous, us going through it again.
George Montana	00:51:19	[IUnintelligible].
Michael McClure	00:51:23	Sure, let's see if it picks up.
George Montana	00:51:24	I think it's picking up
Michael McClure	00:51:25	Yeah?
George Montana	00:51:26	Yeah.
Michael McClure	00:51:27	Can you hear us whispering?
Audience	00:51:28	Yes.
Unknown	00:51:30	Ambient Sound [music].
Michael McClure	00:51:41	Let's see what it sounds like.
Michael McClure	00:51:43	Is it picking up? Can you hear in the back? Can you hear in the back row? Yeah, I think I lost that pic already. Christ. 
Michael McClure and George Montana	00:52:17	Perform unnamed song.
Audience	01:01:41	Applause.
Michael McClure	01:01:56	Um, I don't think I can sing. Do you want to do that one?
George Montana	01:02:00	Ah, okay.
Michael McClure	01:02:04	Shall we tell them it's a new song? Why don't you tell them?
George Montana	01:02:07	This is a song that Michael and I just have done, so I don't know the words by heart yet. So here it is.
Michael McClure	01:02:19	And I haven't learned this melody very well yet. Let's get coordinated together. You set the [unintelligible]. You wanna sing it through three times? 
Unknown	01:02:41	Ambient Sound [voices].
Michael McClure	01:02:57	Is this picking up alright? Can you hear it clear, loud enough? No? [Audience laughter]. Get out. [Audience laughter].

Unknown	01:10:59	Ambient Sound [voices].
George Montana	01:12:22	How about the other [unintelligible].
Michael McClure	01:12:31	I don't think I'm up to...
George Montana	01:12:40	We're going to try to do the Allen Ginsberg <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6711">w</a></sup> "For President Walt".
Michael McClure	01:12:43	I think I'm too scared to. We'll try it. I might be too--can you hear alright? I might be too scared. This isn't very complicated, isn't it a two chord one?
Michael McClure and George Montana	01:13:04	Perform "For President Walt" by Allen Ginsberg.
Michael McClure	01:13:20	I can't remember the words.
Michael McClure and George Montana	01:13:31	Perform "For President Walt" by Allen Ginsberg.

Unknown	01:16:39	Ambient Sound [voices].

George Montana	01:17:03	Okay, which one.
Michael McClure	01:17:05	What about "The Bells of Moscow"?
George Montana	01:17:06	That one?

Michael McClure	01:17:20	Named today.
Michael McClure and George Montana	01:17:56	Perform "The Bells of Moscow".
Audience	01:23:06	Applause.
Michael McClure	01:23:17	I don't think that was picking up here. Alright. Or I was too close. More music lovers are leaving. I don't know, we could try the [unintelligible] thing. 
Unknown	01:23:40	Ambient Sound [voices].
Michael McClure	01:24:12	George and I usually do this in my front room. With no light but a candle and the incense, but we can smoke there of course. This is a song by William Blake <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41513">w</a></sup>.
Michael McClure and George Montana	01:24:59	Perform "How sweet I roam’d from field to field" <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19049519">w</a></sup> by William Blake.
