Audience	00:02:34	Applause.
Charles Reznikoff	00:02:56	Very much obliged to the gentleman who introduced me, among other things, for reading something I did. Perhaps I should ask him to read all that I brought along. But to get down to what I have here, let me say, to begin with, a few days ago, I came across in a bookshop a collection of Chinese verse translated into English. At the beginning was the following, written a thousand years ago, and I was very much impressed with it, and permit me to read it to you as a sort of an introduction. This man who wrote in the 11th century, this Chinese, said this: "Poetry presents the thing in order to convey the feeling.  It should be precise about the thing and reticent about the feeling." I thought that was...expressed exactly what I feel, and what I have tried to do, not always, not always, I'm afraid, as well as called for, but a recipe. Among other things, let me begin by reading a couple of things I did also on the way I think verse should be written. And this is from this, By the Waters of Manhattan.

Charles Reznikoff	00:20:42	Now I have a group that I will call 'religious,' for perhaps no better word, and this I call "Meditations on the Fall and Winter Holidays", and the first is “New Year's”. As many of you, or some of you may know, no doubt, the Jewish New Year's comes in the fall. This is based on it.
Charles Reznikoff	00:21:11	Reads "Meditations on the Fall and Winter Holidays: New Year's" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].

Charles Reznikoff	00:24:50	And this I call "Hanukkah" which incidentally is a holiday that's just about to come, and it, as some of you may know, it represents the victory, a festival celebrating the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrians, about 150 B.C.E.
Charles Reznikoff	00:25:14	Reads "Hanukkah" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].
Charles Reznikoff	00:26:59	I don't know why I should be having a cold on this occasion but, [laughter], these things [blows nose]. 
Charles Reznikoff	00:27:18	Reads "The lamps are burning in the synagogue" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956].
Charles Reznikoff	00:28:40	This one I call "Samuel". Samuel in the Bible, of course.
Charles Reznikoff	00:28:47	Reads "Samuel" [from Five Groups of Verse and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].
Charles Reznikoff	00:30:06	These are all from By the Waters of Manhattan, and I'm going to read you, if I may, something quite different, from the volume called Testimony, and which I call "Recitative".
Charles Reznikoff	00:30:27	Reads "Recitative" [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].
Charles Reznikoff	00:31:15	That's the first. This, these, incidentally, I might say, are all based on law cases. Ah...I don't know what...whether that'll excuse their ferocity, but apparently something like that once happened. The names are different. The facts are the same.
Charles Reznikoff	00:31:39	Reads "Tilda was just a child...” [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].
Charles Reznikoff	00:32:49	And this is the third in this. 
Charles Reznikoff	00:32:53	Reads "Years ago, a company procured a body of land..." [from Testimony: the United States (1885-1890); Recitative].
Charles Reznikoff	00:33:44	Now...let's see, if I may, the time...Here is a poem with which I generally end these readings but I don't intend to end this unless you wish me to because I have some other things to read. But I'll end it right here anyway and then we'll see how much time is left. I call this "Kaddish". Now, it's not the Kaddish for mourners that you might know about. It was written at the beginning of the rise of Hitler <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352">w</a></sup>. I did it; I mean, I did the writing, not the Kaddish, which is very old. It was written at the beginning of the rise of Hitler and his influence, and before his extermination program was put into effect. It's really an ancient blessing in the Jewish ritual. And incidentally, I use that word "Torah," and I doubt, it may be strange to many, but James Parks, I notice, in his History of the Jewish People, has defined it, correctly, I think, "The word Torah," he says, "has been defined as law, but is much wider in meaning. It applies a way of life".  Now this is this "Kaddish".
Charles Reznikoff	00:35:09	Reads "Kaddish" [from Separate Way and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]].
Charles Reznikoff	00:36:43	This ends the, let's say the first part. And I'll continue, if you like, with some others, unless you're all...[inaudible]
Audience	00:36:51	Applause.
Charles Reznikoff	00:37:04	Well I, if, I shall continue, if you're not all exhausted. I have here, quite a few things that are not arranged in any way, so they're more or less haphazard. And...this is one. Let's see...well this one is “After Reading Translations of Ancient Texts on Stone and Clay”.
Charles Reznikoff	00:37:37	Reads “After Reading Translations of Ancient Texts on Stone and Clay”.
Charles Reznikoff	00:38:47	Now, these, these are much less organized than that, haphazard, you'll have to take them as they come if we keep on. 
Charles Reznikoff	00:39:00	Reads "As I was wandering with my unhappy thoughts" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].
Charles Reznikoff	00:39:36	Reads "The young fellow walks about with nothing to do" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse]. 
Charles Reznikoff	00:40:09	Reads “A well-phrased eulogy" [from Inscriptions: 1944-1956 and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].
Charles Reznikoff	00:40:44	Reads "On a Sunday, when the place was closed" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down].  
Charles Reznikoff	00:41:12	Now here are two earlier testimony, two or more things based on a law case, which I call "Testimony", and these were included in that same By the Waters of Manhattan. 
By the Waters of Manhattan. 	00:41:28	Reads "The Company had advertised for men" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse. 
Charles Reznikoff	00:43:13	That's the first, and this is the second.
Charles Reznikoff 	00:43:16	Reads "Amelia was just fourteen" from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse.
Charles Reznikoff	00:44:33	That's the second. I have some more I'd like to get at before I close. Well, this I wrote for my wife. Pity she isn't here, but we'll read it in her absence.
Charles Reznikoff	00:44:55	Reads "Malicious women greet you, saying..." [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918–1975].  
 Charles Reznikoff	00:45:38	Now, this, this is a kind of counterpiece to this I have just read. It was not written for my wife. [Laughter].
Charles Reznikoff	00:45:56	Reads "He had with him a bag" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems Of Charles Reznikoff 1918–1975].  
Audience	00:46:38	Laughter. 
Charles Reznikoff	00:46:42	I'm reading this 'cause..."On a seat"...maybe it would....I think this is rather appropriate in view of all the Hebrew things I read.
Charles Reznikoff	00:46:56	Reads "On a seat in the subway" [from Going To and Fro and Walking Up and Down].  
Charles Reznikoff	00:47:41	Reads "Permit me to warn you" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].
Audience	00:47:51	Laughter.
Charles Reznikoff	00:47:59	Reads "These days, the papers in the street" [from Jerusalem the Golden and from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse].
Charles Reznikoff	00:48:36	Let me close, unless it...if I should...with something that I tried to do which may be something to close with. This is based on the Book of Ezra <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131635">w</a></sup>, and the Book of Ezra, according to my note, I've probably forgotten by this time, is, 'This is a rearrangement and a versification of parts of the Fourth Book of Ezra.' And that's what it's called in the appendix to the Vulgate <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131175">w</a></sup>, or two Esdras of the Protestant Apocrypha. And I based this upon a translation of this Book of Ezra from the Syriac by a friend of mine who taught, and I have their permission and all, but the original was probably, there's quite a discussion as to what the original was right, and some scholars believe that it was in Greek, and a Doctor Bocks, who was in, G.H. Bocks, thinks that it was in Hebrew, and Bloch, who was, they had in 42nd Street at the library, didn't think that it was in either Greek or Hebrew, but Aramaic. Anyway, excuse me just, [laughter], anyway, I will read it, and its adaptation of it, and see what one can do with things that you...clear up. 
Charles Reznikoff	00:50:12	Reads “Because I saw the desolation of Zion" [from By the Waters of Manhattan: Selected Verse and published later in The Poems of Charles Reznikoff: 1918-1975]. 
Charles Reznikoff	00:53:33	And I think this is enough, perhaps, for a time. 
Audience	00:53:36	Applause.
George Bowering	00:54:01	What else, thank you very much, Mr. Reznikoff, and I'd just like to repeat that the next reading is at, two weeks from tonight, December the first, Daryl Hine, who's a graduate of the other university.
