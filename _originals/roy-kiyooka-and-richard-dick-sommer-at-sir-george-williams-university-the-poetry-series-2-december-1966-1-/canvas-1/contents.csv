Roy Kiyooka	00:01:25	--want to start off this evening by reading a few poems from my earlier book, the one that Stan mentioned. These poems were written as a result of a summer in Japan <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17">w</a></sup>, and they are very much occasional poems, they address themselves to the particular occasion of having been there, and they were meant in part to account for that experience of having been there, to my numerable friends in Vancouver. I'll begin by reading three very short little poems, they all relate to, what should we call it, the various contexts in which I saw the sculptured image of the Buddha. The first one is called "Waiting Out the Rain".
Roy Kiyooka	00:02:51	Reads "Waiting Out the Rain" [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:03:13	This is "Buddha in the Garden". Again, very brief.
Roy Kiyooka	00:03:23	Reads "Buddha in the Garden" [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:03:47	This is "Sunday at the Temple".
Roy Kiyooka	00:03:53	Reads "Sunday at the Temple" [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:04:20	And this is the image of a Buddha seen in the Kyoto Museum, a reclining figure.
Roy Kiyooka	00:04:30	Reads unnamed poem [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:05:01	Now the next is a sequence of four little poems, very much like the traditional Japanese poems called the Haiku. This is a sequence, the title of which is "The Stone Garden of Ryoanji". The first one goes like this:
Roy Kiyooka	00:05:27	Reads “The Stone Garden of Ryoanji", part 1 [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:05:45	Reads “The Stone Garden of Ryoanji", part 2 [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:06:07	Reads “The Stone Garden of Ryoanji", part 3 [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:06:24	Reads “The Stone Garden of Ryoanji", part 4 [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:06:49	Now this one is called "Children's Shrine". Throughout most of the cities and towns and villages all over Japan you'll find way-side shrines, they're frequently just built into the wall in a very narrow street and people on whatever religious occasion come to worship there. This is a shrine particularly for children. And it goes like this:
Roy Kiyooka	00:07:24	Reads "Children's Shrine" [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:08:41	Well this is rather a long sequence, once more very short poems, there are eleven of them, and the title of the sequence is simply "Higashiyama", now 'higashiyama' means, in English, 'east mountain'.
Roy Kiyooka	00:09:22	Reads "Higashiyama", part 1 [from Kyoto Airs].

Roy Kiyooka	00:12:43	Reads "Higashiyama", part 11 [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:13:01	Well I'll go on to the last poem in the book, this is an attempt, as it were, to sum up the varied experiences that I had there. The poem is called "Itinerary of a View".
Roy Kiyooka	00:13:29	Reads "Itinerary of a View" [from Kyoto Airs].
Roy Kiyooka	00:17:07	I think I need to say a few words about this next group of poems, they were, they're from the book that I am having done at the moment, I started these poems in June 1965 in Montreal when I first came here. I don't know how to tell you this, except that at the time I came, I stayed with Alfred Pinsky <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21997094">w</a></sup>, or rather I stayed at his home, at his invitation, while I was looking for a place to live. Now, this took me about two weeks, it was very hot, and in the evenings I used to go through his library and pick up things and scanned them. One evening I came across this book, which was a biography of the English painter, Stanley Spencer <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1282413">w</a></sup>. Spencer, we could say is perhaps the co-partner in the origin and the form and the content of this book. The book is in three parts, the first part is called the mirror, "The Song the Mirror Sang at Midnight", and it is prefaced by a quotation from Spencer, which goes like this: "I am meeting you all the time, and sending my longing for you into chaos, into the darkness, beyond these walls". I may add that these poems, likewise, are on the whole, very brief, though some are longer.

Roy Kiyooka	00:30:53	There's a terrible draft coming in from the back, I think you're right Dick, we're going to end up with arthritic ankles. Well, this is the second section, and it is called "The Proposal". Once more, prefaced with a remark from Stanley Spencer, a very beautiful one. They are set down, as I found them in the book, I have used them in the context of this section of the book and these four poems, taken from his writings are meant to define certain of her attributes. Now I have given a title to each one of these four poems, and I hope they will clarify the context in which they belong here. "Portrait of the Beloved".
Roy Kiyooka	00:32:06	Reads "Portrait of the Beloved" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].
Roy Kiyooka	00:32:56	This I called "The Marriage".
Roy Kiyooka	00:33:05	Reads "The Marriage" [published later in Nevertheless These Eyes].

Roy Kiyooka	00:35:23	That incidentally, is a description he wrote to a friend about a painting that he in fact had made. From your response, I gathered, it has a comic element, but I don't think that he himself made it that way. [Laughter].
Roy Kiyooka	00:36:05	Reads unnamed poem.
Roy Kiyooka	00:38:04	Reads unnamed poem.
Roy Kiyooka	00:38:36	The first stanza of this two-stanza poem is from Spencer, once again.

Roy Kiyooka	00:40:02	Reads unnamed poem.

Roy Kiyooka	01:00:57	Thank you very much--
Unknown	01:00:59	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
Roy Kiyooka	01:01:00	--and I were reading together, decided we should write one for the occasion, so we have each come up with a haiku. This is my haiku, it's especially for Dick. I have in brackets here, "A gentle admonition to the audience following my reading, and preceding his" and it goes like this: "Let the stone tell how /snow-covered in whiteness, /these words, when his words come."
