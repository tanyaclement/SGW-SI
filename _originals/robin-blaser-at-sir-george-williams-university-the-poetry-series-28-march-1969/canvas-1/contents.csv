Audience	00:02:56	Applause.
Robin Blaser	00:03:00	The marvelous thing about that list of books is that The Boston Poems, in fact, I think I will read one of those, was published and I decided I didn't like the book so there's one copy in the world and I own that copy. So I'm not sure it's fair, to call that a book. I don't think I--but I think I will read, open with that, it now dates back so many years, back to the Boston <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100">w</a></sup> world, when [Jack] Spicer, and [John] Wieners <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1702153">w</a></sup> and I were there together, and a very different scene from anything. [Charles] Olson <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q922978">w</a></sup> was at Black Mountain <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2413277">w</a></sup>, and Wieners in the centre at Boston. This poem is "The Hunger of Sound", and the date of it would be 1956. 
Robin Blaser	00:03:54	Reads "The Hunger of Sound" from The Boston Poems [collected later in The Holy Forest].
Robin Blaser	00:10:38	Now I, I'm a little confused because I've changed the reading now because it was very nice to have people ask for things, so I think I'll read "Cups", which is a...I've worked since 1960 on a book called The Holy Forest and that is composed of several serial poems, the first of which is "Cups", and that is followed by one called "The Park", and one called "The Faerie Queen", then "The Moth Poem", and then the, then there is a group, translated from Gérard de Nerval <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q191305">w</a></sup>, "Les Chimeres", which is also a serial poem, and finally a group called "The Holy Forest", an unfinished group, and I thought I would read "Cups" and then a section, do a little thing on my poetics, an intermission, and then read, if you still are with me, the section I've just finished, called "The Holy Forest". This is "Cups".
Robin Blaser	00:11:47	Reads "Cups" [from Cups]. 
Robin Blaser	00:22:58	Now I'm going to move to my essay called "The Fire", which is meant to, is meant to talk about what people call poetics, I guess. It certainly talks about what I intend to do, what I am doing.

Robin Blaser	00:31:58	Resumes reading "The Fire". 
Robin Blaser	00:43:29	I won't go on to the rest of the essay, I think that's enough. Now...should we have a break, for a minute? Is it the right time for a break? Do you want a break? Because the next section has thirty-two poems, and not great long ones, but it's a move through the...
