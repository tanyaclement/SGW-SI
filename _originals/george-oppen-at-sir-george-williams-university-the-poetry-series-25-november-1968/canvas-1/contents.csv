George Oppen	00:02:48	I think I will, I plan to read two of the longer poems in the last volume, so I will just read the poems. Without pleasantries and so on. We can easily make a conversation if you want afterwards, but I think I better just read the books, read the poems, and I'll make a few intermissions, it's a great deal of poetry both for you and for me, at a single sitting, and we'll make intermissions as however you think, however I think. I'll start with the poem in Of Being Numerous, called "The Route". That's r-o-u-t-e, route.
George Oppen	00:03:37	Reads "The Route" from Of Being Numerous.
