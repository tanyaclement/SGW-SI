George Bowering	00:00:00	I'd like to help you welcome now, D.G. Jones.
D.G. Jones	00:00:13	I'm going to do this because I'm thirsty. It's a little disturbing but I've had a suspicion that this was becoming true for some time, in the last few years, that pretty soon you won't be able to tell the Jew from the Wasp, anyway. It's getting more disconcerting all the time how similar certain things are between me and Eli Mandel. I just hope he's a very good person and lives a long life and has great success in the future. [Audience laughter]. The main thing I want to read tonight is a little bit like Eli's last poem. [laughter]. But it takes a lot more time to get itself said, for good or ill, and I'd like to read a few, a couple shorter poems anyway, before starting that longer poem which takes up a fair amount of the time. I'll read the first book, I mean...[laughter], I'll read the first poem from the book which old oriental George Bowering told you about at the beginning of the program. This poem's called "The Perishing Bird".
D.G. Jones	00:02:53	Reads "The Perishing Bird" [from Phrases from Orpheus].
D.G. Jones	00:05:05	A poem called "Summer is a Poem by Ovid" .
D.G. Jones	00:05:20	Reads "Summer is a Poem by Ovid".
D.G. Jones	00:06:35	Well, this reads well. It starts with a Latin title, it's a kind of letter, actually written in reply to a letter to somebody who accused me of being rather complacent when ironically enough, I felt anything but that at that time. Accused me of being one of the people who didn't have any troubles in life, or not only me but somebody else too, when we had quite a few of our own that were not too dissimilar from those that the other person was talking about. It's about marriage. It's called, to avoid looking too obvious, "De Profundis Conjugii Vox et Responsum''. It's a serious poem though, more or less.
D.G. Jones	00:07:49	Reads “De Profundis Conjugii Vox et Responsum” [from Phrases from Orpheus].
Unknown	00:13:55	[Cut or edit made in tape. Unknown amount of time elapsed].
D.G. Jones	00:13:56	...features of it, particularly carved doors or doors with glass panels carved, and a fountain, whoops. Wrong poem [audience laughter], same person [audience laughter]. The other one was written without any picture, this was written with a picture, "On a Picture of Your House".
D.G. Jones	00:14:49	Reads "On a Picture of Your House" [from Phrases from Orpheus].
D.G. Jones	00:16:44	This poem is the long poem I referred to, it's a kind of confessional poem, it's only about, I suppose, ten years behind Robert Lowell <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q981448">w</a></sup> and the other American poets who have been writing what the critics now call confessional poetry, which is about par, I suppose. This poem was more or less actually complete several years ago, but I got so many things into the poem I wasn't sure how I was going to get out. And I've dickied around with it and possibly added a few more things, and finally I kept what I had in the end anyway, which was simply a way of ducking out I suspect. Though I hope there's some kind of peculiar relationship to the end, and everything else. I haven't been able to find a title for it. "Night Thoughts", might do, but somebody used that. But it's something along this line: the situation, the scheme is to present a kind of series of reminiscences, mediations, memories which disintegrate and become a little more peculiar as time goes on. Then suddenly stops, breaks off with morning. And it's set more or less around my cottage that I had, in Ontario, which wasn't far from where I was born. This is written in sections but I won't bother reading all the numbers, I'll just pause and go on.
D.G. Jones	00:19:00	Reads unnamed poem.
D.G. Jones	00:41:22	Excuse me, I'll read the last point, I was almost there, but I think I'll skip that part.
D.G. Jones	00:41:30	Resumes reading unnamed poem.
D.G. Jones	00:42:35	Excuse me, I didn't feel I was reading that very well. Sorry, it is perhaps a little long. I'll finish quickly. I'd like to just read something a little different. I'll read two poems, one called "Spring Flowers", which will be the first.
D.G. Jones	00:43:22	Reads "Spring Flowers" [published later in Under the Thunder the Flowers Light up the Earth]
D.G. Jones	00:43:56	I seem to be running out of steam. There's one here that's short enough I should be able to get all the way through it. It's called "Under the Thunder", and that's the first line.
D.G. Jones	00:44:15	Reads "Under the Thunder" [poem read is the title of a later publication, Under the Thunder the Flowers Light up the Earth].
D.G. Jones	00:44:21	I'll try one more [audience laughter]. This was written for a number of people who got together--to form a society of a somewhat antiquated name, The League of Canadian Poets <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6509004">w</a></sup>, who met in Toronto <sup><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172">w</a></sup> in October 1968. It's called "To Certain Poets Who Met in Toronto, October 1968" [audience laughter].
D.G. Jones	00:45:03	Reads "To Certain Poets Who Met in Toronto, October 1968".
D.G. Jones	00:46:40	I think I'm sorry, I've run out of steam but...
END	00:46:49	[Cut off abruptly].
